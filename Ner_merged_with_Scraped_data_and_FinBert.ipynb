Kennedy Jr. has gutted a key government panel of vaccine advisors, saying he wants to \\\"re-establish public confidence\\\" in shots.\\nSome health policy experts say firing the committee members will do the opposite.\\n\\\"Rather than restoring public trust, his actions are simply politicizing science and vaccine policy,\\\" Lawrence Gostin, professor of public health law at Georgetown University, told CNBC. \\\"I don't know how it is possible to trust HHS anymore.\\\"\\nGostin and other experts said the move undermines science, disrupts a trusted regulatory process for shots, and could increase public distrust in both vaccinations and federal health agencies. Some experts said the firings could threaten public health, eroding already falling U.S. immunization rates against once-common childhood diseases and making the nation less equipped to grapple with new or existing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.\\nThe potential impact on vaccine manufacturers like Moderna, Merck, Pfizer and BioNTech is less clear, but some analysts say it introduces more uncertainty to the regulatory process around shots.\\nKennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, said Monday he is firing all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The group of independent medical and public health experts reviews vaccine data and makes crucial recommendations that determine who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other efforts.\\nIt is the latest in a series of steps Kennedy has taken as head of HHS to dismantle decades of U.S. vaccination policy standards and chip away at the public's confidence in immunizations. Among his most recent efforts, he dropped the CDC's recommendation for routine Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children and healthy pregnant women, which also sparked outrage in the medical and science community.\\nWhile it is unclear who will replace the current panel, some experts warn that Kennedy could try to appoint members who are sympathetic to his anti-vaccine views. That could lead to politicized recommendations that highlight the harms rather than the benefits of shots or make them widely voluntary, deterring more Americans from receiving shots or vaccinating their children, according to some experts.\\n\\\"It's really important that we recognize that these actions impact everyone,\\\" Dr. Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. \\\"This is not just a committee that was retired. It is a committee whose work has broad implications.\\\"\\nHHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on who will be appointed to the panel, and the concerns from health policy experts.\\nKennedy's 'unfounded' claims and what's next\\nHHS on Monday did not provide a timeline for when it will appoint new members. But the agency in a release said ACIP will still hold a planned meeting from June 25 to 27. A source familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak freely, told CNBC on Monday that entirely new members will run that meeting.\\nIn an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Kennedy claimed that the current ACIP panel has been \\\"plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\\\"\\nBut those allegations are \\\"completely unfounded\\\" and will have a \\\"significant negative impact on Americans of all ages,\\\" Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in an emailed statement.\\nShe said ACIP is a highly qualified group of experts that has \\\"always operated with transparency and a commitment to protecting the public's health.\\\"\\nAll HHS agencies and their advisory panels have also long had rigorous policies for conflicts of interest, and there have been no related issues for years. Members of federal vaccine advisory committees are already required to comply with regulations around disclosing potential conflicts of interest.\\n\\\"The secretary is using conflicts of interest as a ruse to ignore or cherry pick scientific evidence,\\\" Gostin said. \\\"ACIP members fully disclose all potential conflicts and excuse themselves from voting if there are any perceived conflicts.\\\"\\nIn a statement Tuesday, the American Academy of Physician Associates said it is \\\"imperative that the administration acts promptly to reconstruct the committee through an open and transparent process that includes diverse provider voices,\\\" including physician associates.\\nBut Northeastern's Maniar said he wouldn't be surprised if Kennedy taps political appointees who share his views around vaccine science.\\nThat could lead to recommendations that restrict who is eligible for different vaccinations or give much more leeway for individuals to decide whether to get immunized, Maniar said. He added that Kennedy's restacked panel may want to take a longer period of time to vet certain vaccines before they become available, delaying the time it takes for them to reach patients.\\n\\\"It is certainly within the realm of possibility that we will see lower vaccination rates as a result of this,\\\" Maniar said.\\nThat could increase the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases spreading as the U.S. is already grappling with an unprecedented measles outbreak and is heading into a summer season of more travel and crowding, according to Maniar. The new panel's recommendations will also be crucial for children as the nation approaches a new school year in the fall.\\nKennedy's decision contradicts a promise he made to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, during his confirmation hearings. Kennedy told Cassidy, who cast the deciding vote to advance his nomination through the committee at that time, that he would not alter ACIP.\\nOn Monday, Cassidy said in a post on X that the fear is now that \\\"ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.\\\" But he said he will continue to talk with Kennedy to \\\"ensure this is not the case.\\\"\\nImpact on vaccine manufacturers\\nSome Wall Street analysts also said the move is a risk to vaccine manufacturers, which depend on federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC to approve and recommend their products.\\n\\\"At worst, the committee could upend current recommendations for [new] and existing vaccines,\\\" Leerink Partners analyst Daina Graybosch said in a note Monday. But she noted that the firm can't fully quantify the impact of the move before seeing who will replace the current panel.\\nIn a note Monday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said Kennedy's decision is \\\"a negative headwind\\\" to vaccine manufacturers, as new appointees are likely to be more critical of future recommendations.\\nBut he said he expects \\\"most impacts to be broadly muted.\\\" Seigerman pointed to Kennedy's picks to lead the FDA and its division that regulates biological products, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, noting the ultimate selection for each seat did not reflect a \\\"doomsday\\\" scenario.\\nFDA Commissioner Marty Makary and CBER head Vinay Prasad have so far been \\\"less negative for the sector than initially feared,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"While RFK Jr.'s commentary surrounding vaccines has been consistently critical, we believe this has been well established with realistic headwinds largely priced in by the market,\\\" Seigerman said.\",\n          \"Jeremy Bogaisky is a senior editor who covers aerospace and defense.

That has helped the company broaden its vision from just sleep to cardiovascular health, stress & resilience, women's health, and now nutrition and eating habits.\\nIt also means evolving beyond tracking things just with a ring, leading Oura into new partnerships with companies like Dexcom, one of the leaders in glucose biosensing via its glucose monitor, and through features like an AI health coach and the ability to take pictures of your food and upload it into the app for nutrition breakdowns and AI-driven advice.\\nWhile that pushes Oura further into a broader wearables category competing alongside more all-in-one devices like watches from Apple, Google and Samsung, as well as focused fitness devices from companies like Garmin and Whoop, Hale said that the rest of the category \\\"pushes us to go further and farther ahead in creating innovations that are going to blow people's minds.\\\"\\n\\\"We're really focused on the things that matter that are going to change your health picture,\\\" he said.\\nHale said he believes one of the biggest competitors Oura faces is \\\"people just not being aware of the benefits\\\" of wearing the ring, but the company's increased focus on overall health and wellness is resonating with consumers.\\nIn June 2024, Oura announced that it had sold more than 2.5 million rings. Now, about a year later, Hale said the company has \\\"roughly doubled the business, and we continue to grow.\\\"\\nHale said the company had previously announced it was going to do about $500 million in revenue last year, and this year \\\"it's definitely going to be a lot larger than last year.\\\"\\nWhile that doesn't mean an IPO is on the horizon \\u2014 Hale said the company has \\\"some catching up to do before we're ready to be a public company\\\" \\u2014 Oura sees plenty of room ahead to continue to lean into what its ring wearers are increasingly looking for.\\n\\\"We see a world where you might be using some sensor for some amount of time to learn some lesson, but the device you're going to have on your body to monitor your sleep, your activity, your overall health [and] make predictions about your health, will be the Oura Ring,\\\" Hale said.\\nSign up for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the annual Disruptor 50 list, offering a closer look at list-making companies and their innovative founders.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 90,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"US says trade talks with China \\u2018going well\\u2019 as sides reconvene\",\n          \"Glean, gen AI enterprise search startup, raises $150 million in deal adding billions to valuation Generative AI enterprise search startup Glean announced on Tuesday that it raised $150 million in a Series F financing, pushing up its valuation from investors by billions of dollars in less than a year, to $7.2 billion. The company's last fundraising in September 2024 valued Glean at $4.6 billion. On Tuesday, Glean was also named to the CNBC Disruptor 50 list for the second-consecutive year. Glean reported that its annual recurring revenue surpassed $100 million in its last fiscal year, ending Jan. 31, 2025 \\u2014 less than three years after it was launched by a founding team that includes veterans from Google, Meta, and Dropbox. \\\"We're building the platform that brings AI into the fabric of everyday work, connecting people to knowledge, automating tasks, and enabling smarter decisions across the enterprise,\\\" said Arvind Jain, Glean co-founder and CEO, in a release announcing the deal. In early 2025, Glean launched its agentic AI, Glean Agents, which the company says are on pace to support one billion agent actions by year-end. The company's core product is an AI-powered enterprise search platform that integrates with a wide array of workplace apps \\u2014 Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, and Salesforce. Glean uses natural language understanding and machine learning to create a personalized knowledge graph for each user, improving enterprise search results and the ability to generate content, while automating individual workflows and corporate processes. While initially focused on tech industry customers, Glean has expanded to finance, retail and manufacturing. Jain told Deirdre Bosa, anchor of CNBC's \\\"TechCheck,\\\" that the capital will allow Glean to double the size of teams in R&D and sales as it pushes further into the large enterprise market, overseas markets, and into more partnerships similar to recent ones with companies including fellow Disruptor Databricks, Snowflake and Palo Alto Networks. Jain said for many large enterprises across sectors of the economy, the gen AI boom is as much about concern as it is about excitement. \\\"Large enterprises are more worried about this. They don't want to be left behind,\\\" he told CNBC. \\\"The most important thing that I hear from businesses is they are trying to make sure that their workforce becomes AI-first,\\\" he added. Wellington Management led the fundraising, with existing investors Capital One Ventures, Altimeter, Citi, Coatue, DST Global, General Catalyst, ICONIQ Growth, IVP, Kleiner Parkins, Latitude Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sapphire Ventures and Sequoia Capital, all participating in the deal. New investors included Khosla Ventures, Bicycle Capital, Geodesic and Archerman Capital. While consumer-facing gen AI is growing the fastest \\u2014 OpenAI says it is adding millions of users an hour, and on Monday reported annual recurring revenue above $10 billion \\u2014 Jain said the enterprise market has to be thought of in distinct terms. \\\"You have to remember that models like ChatGPT, they don't know anything about your internal company's data,\\\" he said. \\\"We're able to actually use that context and combine it with the power of models to solve real business problems for you.\\\" OpenAI does have its own enterprise business, which recently passed the three-million user mark. While Glean has seen exponential growth in recent years, it will continue to face challenges in a competitive market including Microsoft 365 Copilot, Amazon Q Business and ChatGPT Enterprise, along with offerings from fellow Disruptors Perplexity and Writer. Jain said in some cases its technology is not in competition with, but complementing the large language models being developed for the enterprise, such as fellow Disruptor Anthropic's Claude. But the competition is intensifying from all sides and overlapping. \\\"Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, they all want to actually come into this space that we started,\\\" Jain said. \\\"We have a lead. We have deep enterprise technology that we built over these years. ... We have to keep innovating. And the good thing for Glean is that we're not building a product that's going to get commoditized,\\\" he said. Currently based in Palo Alto, the company will soon be opening a new office in San Francisco to support its growth.

Forbes spoke with four billionaire CEOs who started from scratch, learned from their prior mistakes, overcame long odds and created notable companies that are thriving. Each of them operates in a different industry\\u2014telecom, fintech, construction and IT services\\u2014and each founder brings their own perspective to running and scaling an enterprise. All share the same goal: building a resilient business that delivers on its promises and keeps customers coming back for more. One leadership principle that John Fish has embraced in building Boston-based Suffolk into a $7 billion (2024 revenue) business is that people have to be willing to make mistakes. \\u201cIt\\u2019s humility. That\\u2019s the biggest thing,\\u201d says Fish, age 65. That\\u2019s why years ago he created a \\u201cNo Fault Culture\\u201d at his company. Employees are encouraged to take risks and do things differently, without worrying about short-term costs. \\u201cIf we don\\u2019t innovate we\\u2019ll die,\\u201d says Fish. That\\u2019s why Suffolk has gambled heavily on robots on construction sites and embraced generative AI to help with everything from scheduling to architectural and engineering designs. Fish first adopted this flexible mindset around 2008 during the Great Recession. In just four hours one September day shortly after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the then-$2 billion (revenue) Suffolk lost $1 billion in backlog as customers suddenly canceled plans to build. Fish didn\\u2019t know how he\\u2019d make payroll, but he knew that his company would not survive unless it did things differently. Rather than look to other companies in the construction category, he started studying firms outside his industry, including Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. It was around that time that he decided that Suffolk would start leveraging data to hone in on its competitive edge. Fish began to invest heavily in data and technology. In 2017, he hired MIT grad and McKinsey & Company data scientist Jit Kee Chin as Chief Data Officer. He also brought on 39 analysts to pour through historical data from hundreds of projects and created a mission control center at its headquarters where the findings are studied to help teams make better business decisions. Think Moneyball for construction: data captured from jobsites is monitored on everything from safety to cost to project delays; generative AI then evaluates the findings to spot red flags, by predicting which sites might have safety risks or are more likely to go over budget. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t manage what you can\\u2019t measure,\\u201d says Fish. Part of Suffolk\\u2019s strategy has always been to diversify across regions and sectors to soften the blow in case any one part of the business falters. This flexible approach has also helped the company pivot into new projects. Seven years ago, mixed-use commercial/residential represented 80% of Suffolk\\u2019s revenue. Then Covid and the work from home trend hit office construction hard, pushing Suffolk to reevaluate. Now it\\u2019s just 20% of revenue, with 36% from data centers and more than one-fourth from aviation and universities, including Dartmouth, Boston College and Northeastern. In an industry that has been changing so much\\u2014for the first time in history, construction costs are higher than the value of some finished buildings, Fish says\\u2014he is even more open to new ideas. Every quarter, he invites a company from overseas to come to Boston to exchange ideas and learn from each other. Among recent visitors: Goldbeck GmbH, one of Germany\\u2019s biggest construction companies, known for its focus on efficiency and prefabricated building systems; and Kazakhstan\\u2019s BI Group Construction Holding, which claims to be the top development company in the Central Asian region. Suffolk also sends teams overseas: a group recently spent time in Japan at Takenaka Corp., a more than 400-year-old firm. Some executives also traveled last year to a leadership retreat in Normandy, France, where they attended lectures from Harvard Business School professors and military personnel, and studied leadership case studies from the D-Day invasion. Fish is convinced all of this will help his company survive this time of change. \\u201cThere is a reckoning right now in the industry,\\u201d says Fish. \\u201cWe\\u2019re trying to lead the conversation both from an AI and need-to-digitalize standpoint. If you don\\u2019t go in this direction, you\\u2019ll perish in six to 12 months.\\u201d Ankur Jain founded fintech firm Bilt Rewards in 2019, aiming to replicate the success that airlines like Delta have had with their rewards program\\u2014but targeted at apartment and home renters. Key to the company\\u2019s progress to date: inking deals with a range of crucial partners, from some of the country\\u2019s largest apartment building owners to credit card issuer Mastercard to merchants like Alaska Airlines and Lyft. The beauty of this model is efficient customer acquisition. \\u201cI learned the hard way on my first business that [the] model doesn't work at scale when you're just spending to acquire customers,\\u201d says Jain, referring to Humin, a contact management app that he cofounded in 2012. (Dating app Tinder bought its technology four years later for an undisclosed sum.) These days he doesn\\u2019t have to spend much to acquire customers. His company gets paid by his real estate partners to handle tenants\\u2019 monthly rent payments. In return, renters who choose to join Bilt earn reward points to use at other merchants. For Bilt, getting the first apartment owner to sign on as a partner was hard. \\u201cIt was two years of pitching,\\u201d recalls Jain, age 35. In the middle of the Covid pandemic, when apartment vacancies had risen in places like New York City, property owners became willing to take the risk of working with an unproven startup. In 2021, AvalonBay Communities (owner of 90,000 apartments in 12 states); Related Companies (owner of 73,000 apartments) and Equity Residential (owner of or investor in 84,000 apartments) agreed to bring on Bilt to handle its tenants\\u2019 payments. Bilt later signed deals with outfits like fitness chain SoulCycle and other gyms, rideshare firm Lyft and more than 20,000 restaurants, enabling Bilt Rewards members to earn points each time they take a class, hail a Lyft or have a meal. Every time they do, Bilt gets a sliver of the revenue those members generate. Then Jain\\u2019s company passes a sliver of that back to the property owners (he won\\u2019t say how much). Jain describes Bilt\\u2019s model as having a flywheel effect. \\u201cAs we started getting the first buildings [signed] on and they had success, it then helped us attract more merchants, which then generated more revenue to share back with buildings who were part of the ecosystem, which then helped us sign more [apartment] buildings,\\u201d says Jain. The company has 3.5 million customers and had revenue last year of $275 million, up from $116 million in 2022. Private investors have put more than $550 million into Bilt, valuing the company at $3.25 billion. Robert Hale trained for and ran the Boston Marathon with 30 teammates last year. In August, he and 35 others will ride bikes 186 miles over two days from Sturbridge in western Massachusetts to Provincetown on Cape Cod as part of the Pan-Mass Challenge, an annual fundraising event for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Most workdays, he also joins regulars at a CrossFit training class at 6:30 a.m. and again at noon. An exercise junkie? Maybe. But there is another reason for his fitness regimen: teambuilding. The CEO of $1.8 billion (2024 revenue) Quincy, Massachusetts-based telecom firm Granite Communications describes these and other company activities, from 14 intramural sports teams and charity events to book clubs and game nights, as the \\u201cbedrock\\u201d of Granite. \\u201cIt matters to everyone to be a part of a community they care for,\\u201d says Hale, 58, who insists that keeping his 2,000 employees happy is key to the company\\u2019s success. Before Granite, he started another telecom firm, Network Plus. Wooed by Wall Street, Hale took on debt and then took it public in 1999. But it struggled amid the dot-com bust and declared bankruptcy in 2002, laying off hundreds of workers. It had a big impact on him. \\u201cI was focused on 90-day thresholds,\\u201d he says, not his team\\u2014and not on the long term. He hasn\\u2019t made that mistake again, choosing to keep Granite private so he could run it as he sees fit. Beyond the perks are real benefits: Granite commits to almost exclusively promoting employees from within and gives managers a pool of money to dole out as promotions and raises. Granite employees, in turn, are the ones who keep its 17,000 customers, including 75% of America\\u2019s biggest companies (Nike and CVS, for instance), happy. \\u201cThere is a vigorous emphasis on making customers happy through thick and thin, and that in turn makes [staffers] happy,\\u201d says Hale. \\u201cHappy customers, happy teammates, full circle.\\u201d Maybe it\\u2019s because Raj Sardana arrived in the U.S. from India with just $100 in his pocket. Or maybe it\\u2019s because the Georgia Tech graduate got laid off from his early job as an electrical engineer at a Pratt & Whitney supplier. Whatever the reason, Sardana is always obsessing over what his IT services provider, Innova Solutions, can do next for its customers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re paranoid. That\\u2019s why we work so hard,\\u201d says the self-made billionaire, who claims to still work 18 hours a day, seven days a week making sure Innova delivers more to its customers than it promises. \\u201cWe\\u2019re client focused. We understand their pain points and solve them with technology,\\u201d adds Sardana, age 65. Back when Innova\\u2019s predecessor, American CyberSystems, was getting started in the late 1990s, Sardana brought Indian programmers over on H1-B visas to help U.S. firms prepare for the Y2K \\u201cmillennium bug.\\u201d That crisis ended quickly but then came the September 11th terrorist attacks. Leveraging his aerospace background, he began supplying much-needed engineering talent to defense contractors like Northrop Grumman. Nowadays there\\u2019s a lot more competition in the world of outsourcing, and Innova gambled on acquisitions to keep pace, picking up attractive clients like Tesla and Harley Davidson. It bought six companies in 2021 and 2022, tripling its revenue to $2.4 billion. Innova hopes to win more business from existing customers. \\u201cMarketing is not my strength. Instead I make sure we deliver excellence,\\u201d says Sardana. \\u201cIf we acquire a client from [an] acquisition, we wow them with delivery.\\u201d One Sardana says they wowed is a large North American bank, which Innova added to its client list as part of a 2021 acquisition; since then, the bank has increased its spending with Innova by 37% to $80 million annually. Last year Innova\\u2019s revenue dipped to $2.3 billion as it jettisoned money-losing clients and focused on profitability, more than doubling its net profit margin to 6%, but it\\u2019s hoping for more wins ahead. Innova is working quickly to incorporate generative AI to improve cost optimization. In one case, it is using AI on behalf of a telecom client to automate test cases, or essentially checklists that help make sure software is functioning properly; that in turn helped cut its quality engineering costs by 30% and reduced the number of Innova staffers needed for that client to 219 from 300. Says Sardana, \\u201cWe always have to be on the cutting edge. We\\u2019re always looking ahead of the curve.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Neutral\",\n          \"Negative\",\n          \"Positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"confidence\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.10875859256022212,\n        \"min\": 0.5244,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 59,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9999,\n          0.9658,\n          0.9477\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Kennedy Jr. has gutted a key government panel of vaccine advisors, saying he wants to \\\"re-establish public confidence\\\" in shots.\\nSome health policy experts say firing the committee members will do the opposite.\\n\\\"Rather than restoring public trust, his actions are simply politicizing science and vaccine policy,\\\" Lawrence Gostin, professor of public health law at Georgetown University, told CNBC. \\\"I don't know how it is possible to trust HHS anymore.\\\"\\nGostin and other experts said the move undermines science, disrupts a trusted regulatory process for shots, and could increase public distrust in both vaccinations and federal health agencies. Some experts said the firings could threaten public health, eroding already falling U.S. immunization rates against once-common childhood diseases and making the nation less equipped to grapple with new or existing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.\\nThe potential impact on vaccine manufacturers like Moderna, Merck, Pfizer and BioNTech is less clear, but some analysts say it introduces more uncertainty to the regulatory process around shots.\\nKennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, said Monday he is firing all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The group of independent medical and public health experts reviews vaccine data and makes crucial recommendations that determine who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other efforts.\\nIt is the latest in a series of steps Kennedy has taken as head of HHS to dismantle decades of U.S. vaccination policy standards and chip away at the public's confidence in immunizations. Among his most recent efforts, he dropped the CDC's recommendation for routine Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children and healthy pregnant women, which also sparked outrage in the medical and science community.\\nWhile it is unclear who will replace the current panel, some experts warn that Kennedy could try to appoint members who are sympathetic to his anti-vaccine views. That could lead to politicized recommendations that highlight the harms rather than the benefits of shots or make them widely voluntary, deterring more Americans from receiving shots or vaccinating their children, according to some experts.\\n\\\"It's really important that we recognize that these actions impact everyone,\\\" Dr. Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. \\\"This is not just a committee that was retired. It is a committee whose work has broad implications.\\\"\\nHHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on who will be appointed to the panel, and the concerns from health policy experts.\\nKennedy's 'unfounded' claims and what's next\\nHHS on Monday did not provide a timeline for when it will appoint new members. But the agency in a release said ACIP will still hold a planned meeting from June 25 to 27. A source familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak freely, told CNBC on Monday that entirely new members will run that meeting.\\nIn an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Kennedy claimed that the current ACIP panel has been \\\"plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\\\"\\nBut those allegations are \\\"completely unfounded\\\" and will have a \\\"significant negative impact on Americans of all ages,\\\" Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in an emailed statement.\\nShe said ACIP is a highly qualified group of experts that has \\\"always operated with transparency and a commitment to protecting the public's health.\\\"\\nAll HHS agencies and their advisory panels have also long had rigorous policies for conflicts of interest, and there have been no related issues for years. Members of federal vaccine advisory committees are already required to comply with regulations around disclosing potential conflicts of interest.\\n\\\"The secretary is using conflicts of interest as a ruse to ignore or cherry pick scientific evidence,\\\" Gostin said. \\\"ACIP members fully disclose all potential conflicts and excuse themselves from voting if there are any perceived conflicts.\\\"\\nIn a statement Tuesday, the American Academy of Physician Associates said it is \\\"imperative that the administration acts promptly to reconstruct the committee through an open and transparent process that includes diverse provider voices,\\\" including physician associates.\\nBut Northeastern's Maniar said he wouldn't be surprised if Kennedy taps political appointees who share his views around vaccine science.\\nThat could lead to recommendations that restrict who is eligible for different vaccinations or give much more leeway for individuals to decide whether to get immunized, Maniar said. He added that Kennedy's restacked panel may want to take a longer period of time to vet certain vaccines before they become available, delaying the time it takes for them to reach patients.\\n\\\"It is certainly within the realm of possibility that we will see lower vaccination rates as a result of this,\\\" Maniar said.\\nThat could increase the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases spreading as the U.S. is already grappling with an unprecedented measles outbreak and is heading into a summer season of more travel and crowding, according to Maniar. The new panel's recommendations will also be crucial for children as the nation approaches a new school year in the fall.\\nKennedy's decision contradicts a promise he made to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, during his confirmation hearings. Kennedy told Cassidy, who cast the deciding vote to advance his nomination through the committee at that time, that he would not alter ACIP.\\nOn Monday, Cassidy said in a post on X that the fear is now that \\\"ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.\\\" But he said he will continue to talk with Kennedy to \\\"ensure this is not the case.\\\"\\nImpact on vaccine manufacturers\\nSome Wall Street analysts also said the move is a risk to vaccine manufacturers, which depend on federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC to approve and recommend their products.\\n\\\"At worst, the committee could upend current recommendations for [new] and existing vaccines,\\\" Leerink Partners analyst Daina Graybosch said in a note Monday. But she noted that the firm can't fully quantify the impact of the move before seeing who will replace the current panel.\\nIn a note Monday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said Kennedy's decision is \\\"a negative headwind\\\" to vaccine manufacturers, as new appointees are likely to be more critical of future recommendations.\\nBut he said he expects \\\"most impacts to be broadly muted.\\\" Seigerman pointed to Kennedy's picks to lead the FDA and its division that regulates biological products, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, noting the ultimate selection for each seat did not reflect a \\\"doomsday\\\" scenario.\\nFDA Commissioner Marty Makary and CBER head Vinay Prasad have so far been \\\"less negative for the sector than initially feared,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"While RFK Jr.'s commentary surrounding vaccines has been consistently critical, we believe this has been well established with realistic headwinds largely priced in by the market,\\\" Seigerman said.\",\n          \"Jeremy Bogaisky is a senior editor who covers aerospace and defense.

That has helped the company broaden its vision from just sleep to cardiovascular health, stress & resilience, women's health, and now nutrition and eating habits.\\nIt also means evolving beyond tracking things just with a ring, leading Oura into new partnerships with companies like Dexcom, one of the leaders in glucose biosensing via its glucose monitor, and through features like an AI health coach and the ability to take pictures of your food and upload it into the app for nutrition breakdowns and AI-driven advice.\\nWhile that pushes Oura further into a broader wearables category competing alongside more all-in-one devices like watches from Apple, Google and Samsung, as well as focused fitness devices from companies like Garmin and Whoop, Hale said that the rest of the category \\\"pushes us to go further and farther ahead in creating innovations that are going to blow people's minds.\\\"\\n\\\"We're really focused on the things that matter that are going to change your health picture,\\\" he said.\\nHale said he believes one of the biggest competitors Oura faces is \\\"people just not being aware of the benefits\\\" of wearing the ring, but the company's increased focus on overall health and wellness is resonating with consumers.\\nIn June 2024, Oura announced that it had sold more than 2.5 million rings. Now, about a year later, Hale said the company has \\\"roughly doubled the business, and we continue to grow.\\\"\\nHale said the company had previously announced it was going to do about $500 million in revenue last year, and this year \\\"it's definitely going to be a lot larger than last year.\\\"\\nWhile that doesn't mean an IPO is on the horizon \\u2014 Hale said the company has \\\"some catching up to do before we're ready to be a public company\\\" \\u2014 Oura sees plenty of room ahead to continue to lean into what its ring wearers are increasingly looking for.\\n\\\"We see a world where you might be using some sensor for some amount of time to learn some lesson, but the device you're going to have on your body to monitor your sleep, your activity, your overall health [and] make predictions about your health, will be the Oura Ring,\\\" Hale said.\\nSign up for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the annual Disruptor 50 list, offering a closer look at list-making companies and their innovative founders.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 90,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"US says trade talks with China \\u2018going well\\u2019 as sides reconvene\",\n          \"Glean, gen AI enterprise search startup, raises $150 million in deal adding billions to valuation Generative AI enterprise search startup Glean announced on Tuesday that it raised $150 million in a Series F financing, pushing up its valuation from investors by billions of dollars in less than a year, to $7.2 billion. The company's last fundraising in September 2024 valued Glean at $4.6 billion. On Tuesday, Glean was also named to the CNBC Disruptor 50 list for the second-consecutive year. Glean reported that its annual recurring revenue surpassed $100 million in its last fiscal year, ending Jan. 31, 2025 \\u2014 less than three years after it was launched by a founding team that includes veterans from Google, Meta, and Dropbox. \\\"We're building the platform that brings AI into the fabric of everyday work, connecting people to knowledge, automating tasks, and enabling smarter decisions across the enterprise,\\\" said Arvind Jain, Glean co-founder and CEO, in a release announcing the deal. In early 2025, Glean launched its agentic AI, Glean Agents, which the company says are on pace to support one billion agent actions by year-end. The company's core product is an AI-powered enterprise search platform that integrates with a wide array of workplace apps \\u2014 Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, and Salesforce. Glean uses natural language understanding and machine learning to create a personalized knowledge graph for each user, improving enterprise search results and the ability to generate content, while automating individual workflows and corporate processes. While initially focused on tech industry customers, Glean has expanded to finance, retail and manufacturing. Jain told Deirdre Bosa, anchor of CNBC's \\\"TechCheck,\\\" that the capital will allow Glean to double the size of teams in R&D and sales as it pushes further into the large enterprise market, overseas markets, and into more partnerships similar to recent ones with companies including fellow Disruptor Databricks, Snowflake and Palo Alto Networks. Jain said for many large enterprises across sectors of the economy, the gen AI boom is as much about concern as it is about excitement. \\\"Large enterprises are more worried about this. They don't want to be left behind,\\\" he told CNBC. \\\"The most important thing that I hear from businesses is they are trying to make sure that their workforce becomes AI-first,\\\" he added. Wellington Management led the fundraising, with existing investors Capital One Ventures, Altimeter, Citi, Coatue, DST Global, General Catalyst, ICONIQ Growth, IVP, Kleiner Parkins, Latitude Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sapphire Ventures and Sequoia Capital, all participating in the deal. New investors included Khosla Ventures, Bicycle Capital, Geodesic and Archerman Capital. While consumer-facing gen AI is growing the fastest \\u2014 OpenAI says it is adding millions of users an hour, and on Monday reported annual recurring revenue above $10 billion \\u2014 Jain said the enterprise market has to be thought of in distinct terms. \\\"You have to remember that models like ChatGPT, they don't know anything about your internal company's data,\\\" he said. \\\"We're able to actually use that context and combine it with the power of models to solve real business problems for you.\\\" OpenAI does have its own enterprise business, which recently passed the three-million user mark. While Glean has seen exponential growth in recent years, it will continue to face challenges in a competitive market including Microsoft 365 Copilot, Amazon Q Business and ChatGPT Enterprise, along with offerings from fellow Disruptors Perplexity and Writer. Jain said in some cases its technology is not in competition with, but complementing the large language models being developed for the enterprise, such as fellow Disruptor Anthropic's Claude. But the competition is intensifying from all sides and overlapping. \\\"Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, they all want to actually come into this space that we started,\\\" Jain said. \\\"We have a lead. We have deep enterprise technology that we built over these years. ... We have to keep innovating. And the good thing for Glean is that we're not building a product that's going to get commoditized,\\\" he said. Currently based in Palo Alto, the company will soon be opening a new office in San Francisco to support its growth.

Forbes spoke with four billionaire CEOs who started from scratch, learned from their prior mistakes, overcame long odds and created notable companies that are thriving. Each of them operates in a different industry\\u2014telecom, fintech, construction and IT services\\u2014and each founder brings their own perspective to running and scaling an enterprise. All share the same goal: building a resilient business that delivers on its promises and keeps customers coming back for more. One leadership principle that John Fish has embraced in building Boston-based Suffolk into a $7 billion (2024 revenue) business is that people have to be willing to make mistakes. \\u201cIt\\u2019s humility. That\\u2019s the biggest thing,\\u201d says Fish, age 65. That\\u2019s why years ago he created a \\u201cNo Fault Culture\\u201d at his company. Employees are encouraged to take risks and do things differently, without worrying about short-term costs. \\u201cIf we don\\u2019t innovate we\\u2019ll die,\\u201d says Fish. That\\u2019s why Suffolk has gambled heavily on robots on construction sites and embraced generative AI to help with everything from scheduling to architectural and engineering designs. Fish first adopted this flexible mindset around 2008 during the Great Recession. In just four hours one September day shortly after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the then-$2 billion (revenue) Suffolk lost $1 billion in backlog as customers suddenly canceled plans to build. Fish didn\\u2019t know how he\\u2019d make payroll, but he knew that his company would not survive unless it did things differently. Rather than look to other companies in the construction category, he started studying firms outside his industry, including Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. It was around that time that he decided that Suffolk would start leveraging data to hone in on its competitive edge. Fish began to invest heavily in data and technology. In 2017, he hired MIT grad and McKinsey & Company data scientist Jit Kee Chin as Chief Data Officer. He also brought on 39 analysts to pour through historical data from hundreds of projects and created a mission control center at its headquarters where the findings are studied to help teams make better business decisions. Think Moneyball for construction: data captured from jobsites is monitored on everything from safety to cost to project delays; generative AI then evaluates the findings to spot red flags, by predicting which sites might have safety risks or are more likely to go over budget. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t manage what you can\\u2019t measure,\\u201d says Fish. Part of Suffolk\\u2019s strategy has always been to diversify across regions and sectors to soften the blow in case any one part of the business falters. This flexible approach has also helped the company pivot into new projects. Seven years ago, mixed-use commercial/residential represented 80% of Suffolk\\u2019s revenue. Then Covid and the work from home trend hit office construction hard, pushing Suffolk to reevaluate. Now it\\u2019s just 20% of revenue, with 36% from data centers and more than one-fourth from aviation and universities, including Dartmouth, Boston College and Northeastern. In an industry that has been changing so much\\u2014for the first time in history, construction costs are higher than the value of some finished buildings, Fish says\\u2014he is even more open to new ideas. Every quarter, he invites a company from overseas to come to Boston to exchange ideas and learn from each other. Among recent visitors: Goldbeck GmbH, one of Germany\\u2019s biggest construction companies, known for its focus on efficiency and prefabricated building systems; and Kazakhstan\\u2019s BI Group Construction Holding, which claims to be the top development company in the Central Asian region. Suffolk also sends teams overseas: a group recently spent time in Japan at Takenaka Corp., a more than 400-year-old firm. Some executives also traveled last year to a leadership retreat in Normandy, France, where they attended lectures from Harvard Business School professors and military personnel, and studied leadership case studies from the D-Day invasion. Fish is convinced all of this will help his company survive this time of change. \\u201cThere is a reckoning right now in the industry,\\u201d says Fish. \\u201cWe\\u2019re trying to lead the conversation both from an AI and need-to-digitalize standpoint. If you don\\u2019t go in this direction, you\\u2019ll perish in six to 12 months.\\u201d Ankur Jain founded fintech firm Bilt Rewards in 2019, aiming to replicate the success that airlines like Delta have had with their rewards program\\u2014but targeted at apartment and home renters. Key to the company\\u2019s progress to date: inking deals with a range of crucial partners, from some of the country\\u2019s largest apartment building owners to credit card issuer Mastercard to merchants like Alaska Airlines and Lyft. The beauty of this model is efficient customer acquisition. \\u201cI learned the hard way on my first business that [the] model doesn't work at scale when you're just spending to acquire customers,\\u201d says Jain, referring to Humin, a contact management app that he cofounded in 2012. (Dating app Tinder bought its technology four years later for an undisclosed sum.) These days he doesn\\u2019t have to spend much to acquire customers. His company gets paid by his real estate partners to handle tenants\\u2019 monthly rent payments. In return, renters who choose to join Bilt earn reward points to use at other merchants. For Bilt, getting the first apartment owner to sign on as a partner was hard. \\u201cIt was two years of pitching,\\u201d recalls Jain, age 35. In the middle of the Covid pandemic, when apartment vacancies had risen in places like New York City, property owners became willing to take the risk of working with an unproven startup. In 2021, AvalonBay Communities (owner of 90,000 apartments in 12 states); Related Companies (owner of 73,000 apartments) and Equity Residential (owner of or investor in 84,000 apartments) agreed to bring on Bilt to handle its tenants\\u2019 payments. Bilt later signed deals with outfits like fitness chain SoulCycle and other gyms, rideshare firm Lyft and more than 20,000 restaurants, enabling Bilt Rewards members to earn points each time they take a class, hail a Lyft or have a meal. Every time they do, Bilt gets a sliver of the revenue those members generate. Then Jain\\u2019s company passes a sliver of that back to the property owners (he won\\u2019t say how much). Jain describes Bilt\\u2019s model as having a flywheel effect. \\u201cAs we started getting the first buildings [signed] on and they had success, it then helped us attract more merchants, which then generated more revenue to share back with buildings who were part of the ecosystem, which then helped us sign more [apartment] buildings,\\u201d says Jain. The company has 3.5 million customers and had revenue last year of $275 million, up from $116 million in 2022. Private investors have put more than $550 million into Bilt, valuing the company at $3.25 billion. Robert Hale trained for and ran the Boston Marathon with 30 teammates last year. In August, he and 35 others will ride bikes 186 miles over two days from Sturbridge in western Massachusetts to Provincetown on Cape Cod as part of the Pan-Mass Challenge, an annual fundraising event for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Most workdays, he also joins regulars at a CrossFit training class at 6:30 a.m. and again at noon. An exercise junkie? Maybe. But there is another reason for his fitness regimen: teambuilding. The CEO of $1.8 billion (2024 revenue) Quincy, Massachusetts-based telecom firm Granite Communications describes these and other company activities, from 14 intramural sports teams and charity events to book clubs and game nights, as the \\u201cbedrock\\u201d of Granite. \\u201cIt matters to everyone to be a part of a community they care for,\\u201d says Hale, 58, who insists that keeping his 2,000 employees happy is key to the company\\u2019s success. Before Granite, he started another telecom firm, Network Plus. Wooed by Wall Street, Hale took on debt and then took it public in 1999. But it struggled amid the dot-com bust and declared bankruptcy in 2002, laying off hundreds of workers. It had a big impact on him. \\u201cI was focused on 90-day thresholds,\\u201d he says, not his team\\u2014and not on the long term. He hasn\\u2019t made that mistake again, choosing to keep Granite private so he could run it as he sees fit. Beyond the perks are real benefits: Granite commits to almost exclusively promoting employees from within and gives managers a pool of money to dole out as promotions and raises. Granite employees, in turn, are the ones who keep its 17,000 customers, including 75% of America\\u2019s biggest companies (Nike and CVS, for instance), happy. \\u201cThere is a vigorous emphasis on making customers happy through thick and thin, and that in turn makes [staffers] happy,\\u201d says Hale. \\u201cHappy customers, happy teammates, full circle.\\u201d Maybe it\\u2019s because Raj Sardana arrived in the U.S. from India with just $100 in his pocket. Or maybe it\\u2019s because the Georgia Tech graduate got laid off from his early job as an electrical engineer at a Pratt & Whitney supplier. Whatever the reason, Sardana is always obsessing over what his IT services provider, Innova Solutions, can do next for its customers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re paranoid. That\\u2019s why we work so hard,\\u201d says the self-made billionaire, who claims to still work 18 hours a day, seven days a week making sure Innova delivers more to its customers than it promises. \\u201cWe\\u2019re client focused. We understand their pain points and solve them with technology,\\u201d adds Sardana, age 65. Back when Innova\\u2019s predecessor, American CyberSystems, was getting started in the late 1990s, Sardana brought Indian programmers over on H1-B visas to help U.S. firms prepare for the Y2K \\u201cmillennium bug.\\u201d That crisis ended quickly but then came the September 11th terrorist attacks. Leveraging his aerospace background, he began supplying much-needed engineering talent to defense contractors like Northrop Grumman. Nowadays there\\u2019s a lot more competition in the world of outsourcing, and Innova gambled on acquisitions to keep pace, picking up attractive clients like Tesla and Harley Davidson. It bought six companies in 2021 and 2022, tripling its revenue to $2.4 billion. Innova hopes to win more business from existing customers. \\u201cMarketing is not my strength. Instead I make sure we deliver excellence,\\u201d says Sardana. \\u201cIf we acquire a client from [an] acquisition, we wow them with delivery.\\u201d One Sardana says they wowed is a large North American bank, which Innova added to its client list as part of a 2021 acquisition; since then, the bank has increased its spending with Innova by 37% to $80 million annually. Last year Innova\\u2019s revenue dipped to $2.3 billion as it jettisoned money-losing clients and focused on profitability, more than doubling its net profit margin to 6%, but it\\u2019s hoping for more wins ahead. Innova is working quickly to incorporate generative AI to improve cost optimization. In one case, it is using AI on behalf of a telecom client to automate test cases, or essentially checklists that help make sure software is functioning properly; that in turn helped cut its quality engineering costs by 30% and reduced the number of Innova staffers needed for that client to 219 from 300. Says Sardana, \\u201cWe always have to be on the cutting edge. We\\u2019re always looking ahead of the curve.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Neutral\",\n          \"Negative\",\n          \"Positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"confidence\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.10875859256022212,\n        \"min\": 0.5244,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 59,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9999,\n          0.9658,\n          0.9477\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"entities\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
