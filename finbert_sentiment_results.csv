CNBC,"Apple's WWDC underwhelms on AI, but software gets biggest facelift in over a decade",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/apple-wwdc-underwhelms-on-ai-software-biggest-facelift-in-decade-.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 18:00:01 GMT","Apple's annual developer conference on Monday lacked the splashy announcement that fans are used to seeing at WWDC. There was nothing like the Vision Pro reveal from 2023 or the Apple Intelligence announcement last year.
But there was an important software update that, later this year, will change the way all of Apple's major devices, from iPhones and Mac laptops to Vision Pro virtual reality headsets, will look. It's a new design language that runs across all of Apple's operating systems. The company is calling it Liquid Glass.
For Apple, it's the first significant redesign of its iPhone operating system since 2013, when the company announced iOS7. Apple says the lock screen will look like it's made out of glass. Buttons will turn into little glass pills, fluidly sliding over glass rails. And there are new animations, including when answering a phone call.
The unveiling underwhelmed Wall Street, which sent the stock down 1.2% on the day. Investors are pressuring Apple to make big changes to its artificial intelligence strategy, pushing it to match the frontier model capabilities of rivals such as Google and OpenAI.
""Many of the AI features announced were more incremental in our view, and already available through competitor applications,"" UBS analyst David Vogt wrote in a note Monday. He has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock.
Last year, Apple announced Apple Intelligence, its response to ChatGPT, complete with a demo of a ""more personal"" Siri that could intelligently parse through emails and messages to figure out the best time to make a restaurant reservation. Apple delayed the feature in March, had to pull ads that depicted it, and provided no update on timing on Monday.
""This work needed more time to meet our high-quality bar,"" Apple software chief Craig Federighi said Monday. He restated the company's ""the coming year"" timeline.
Liquid glass design
Apple's focus at WWDC was on providing new features and animations across its software that are ""delightful,"" in CEO Tim Cook's words.
The new design language is heavy on transparent buttons, sliders and other interaction elements. Users will be able to spot it as soon as they upgrade their phones to the new iOS, which will be available for beta testing this summer.
Instead of hard, sharp corners in rectangular windows, Apple's new design language has curved corners that match the device.
One reason Apple gave for rolling out the update now is that its computers and chips have become powerful enough to handle it. Apple said that its new look was directly inspired by the look of VisionOS, the company's software for Vision Pro.
""Apple Silicon has become dramatically more powerful — enabling software, materials and experiences we once could only dream of,"" Federighi said in a recorded video.
As with many Apple announcements, reactions are all over the map. Some people on social media were excited while others compared the update to the look of Windows Vista, which was released in 2007.
While Apple didn't make many significant changes to the Siri experience, the company did introduce a few significant improvements and changes to its AI capabilities.
Apple also expanded its integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT, integrating its image generation capabilities into an app that previously only used Apple's technology.
When a user takes a screenshot on an iPhone, a new button will send the image to ChatGPT, which can summarize blocks of text in the image, or even decipher what's happening.
One major improvement Apple is rolling out is in language translation.
During a phone call between two people who don't speak the same language, the phone app can translate a sentence after it's spoken and use an AI-generated voice to speak to the other party in the their language. Apple says the feature uses AI processed on the iPhone and doesn't require a connection to a server.
New numbers
In some corners of the Apple fan universe, the most notable announcement on Monday may involve a simple number.
Since 2007, Apple had introduced a new version of its iOS every year. By 2024, Apple was on iOS 18. It's a meaningful number for users who want to know if they have the latest Apple features, and some 82% of users with recent iPhones had upgraded to iOS 18 within a year.
Now, Apple is naming its operating systems for the iPhone and other devices after the year that they'll be available for use by most consumers. In this case, it's 2026.
In September, users will upgrade to iOS 26. Apple also has iPadOS 26, WatchOS 26, tvOS 26 and Vision OS 26.
The name change will simplify how to refer to the various operating systems, which had gotten confusing given that each device was on a different generation. It also maintains the pressure on Apple to keep rolling out an update every year, or else the number will make it clear that its software is outdated.","Apple's WWDC underwhelms on AI, but software gets biggest facelift in over a decade Apple's annual developer conference on Monday lacked the splashy announcement that fans are used to seeing at WWDC.

CNBC,"Google overhauls internal learning platform to focus on AI, 'business priorities'",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/google-grow-learning-platform-ai.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 18:46:31 GMT","Google is overhauling a popular internal learning platform to focus on teaching employees how to use modern artificial intelligence tools in their daily work routines, CNBC has learned.
Grow, as the learning service is called, was previously filled with a wide array of courses, ranging from teaching Google employees how to build products, use 3D printers, help with their personal finance or even how to solve a Rubik's cube. Those offerings have all been replaced primarily by AI-related courses.
The revamp underscores how companies, both within and outside of tech, are racing to train their employees on the advanced AI tools that have been created since OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 ushered in the age of generative AI.
Employees with previously scheduled Grow sessions were notified in the spring that the sessions they signed up for would be cancelled and that course materials would be archived, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. Grow, which was started more than 10 years ago, had grown to more than 500,000 listings before the AI shakeup. Grow is popular among employees and is considered to be one of the unique perks of working at Google, according to sources and an internal discussion forum.
""We have an active learning culture with numerous in-house courses tied to company priorities, along with generous educational reimbursement,"" a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""Our internal course offerings have ballooned since we launched it ten years ago, and we're refreshing Grow to help employees find the most relevant learning opportunities.""
The move to overhaul Grow shows that Google is shifting away from some of its nice-to-have programs to more business-essential offerings as it streamlines operations to prioritize AI. As the company fights to retain its relevance in search amid a heated AI arms race, it has streamlined operations, headcount and employee benefits.
Google has enacted rolling layoffs within several units across the company, particularly after finance chief Anat Ashkenazi's said last fall that the company could ""push a little further"" on cost cuts. Google, like many other tech giants, has also rolled back programs like its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, trainings amid business streamlining as well as from President Trump's executive orders.
In a memo sent out to employees who had created Grow courses, Google leaders wrote that many of the platform's ""courses were unused,"" and ""not relevant to the work we do today,"" according to an internal message.
""Those that orgs have confirmed are up-to-date and focused on business priorities will still be available,"" wrote Google's people operations staff.
Employees commented on an internal forum that the use of ""focused on business priorities"" reiterated a sign of the times — Google is primarily focused on programs that contribute to the bottom line.

CNBC,Inflation readings and Treasury auctions to test the bond market. Here's what to expect,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/inflation-data-treasury-auctions-to-test-the-bond-market-what-to-expect.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 18:10:22 GMT","Key readings on inflation combined with two critical Treasury auctions this week offer a major test for the battered bond market.
On the inflation front, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases separate reports for May — consumer prices on Wednesday, then producer prices on Thursday.
While economists are looking for only modest increases from both, any upside surprises could rattle investors wary of inflation pressures, primarily stemming from President Donald Trump's tariffs, that could threaten the labor market and economic growth.
At the same time, the government debt sales, because they involve long-duration securities, will provide important clues about investor appetite for Treasurys at a time when debt and deficits are attracting increased attention both in financial markets and from economists. The Treasury Department will sell $39 billion of 10-year notes Wednesday, then $22 billion of 30-year bonds Thursday.
Richard de Chazal, macro analyst at William Blair, wrote that the auctions in particular are ""shaping up to be a referendum on government debt policies"" even as market indicators ""have been gently moderating over the last couple of weeks and not indicative of any major near-term inflationary stress.""
Together, the results could have important implications for the direction of the economy and the reaction of the Federal Reserve and its approach to interest rate policy. Throw in the spending bill making its way through Congress, and it sets up the fixed income market for more volatility.
""At the risk of being trite, this time it's different. A big reason is because the deficit level is much higher,"" said Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies. ""The reason why it's also different is sometimes things crack, suddenly. It is very difficult to predict when exactly the crack is going to come.""
Multiple concerns at play
Indeed, the debt and deficit situation has emerged as an important backdrop for bonds after the market ignored the swelling government red ink for years. Yields have surged as investors have demanded higher compensation for holding what has always been considered a risk-free investment in U.S. government debt.
Other concerns include Trump's ""big, beautiful"" spending bill, as well as what ultimately will be the extent of his tariffs.
""We are still continuing in a relatively benign atmosphere,"" Sri-Kumar said. ""But the unknown here is that I am very worried about the yield suddenly shooting up.""
This week's results, then, will be watched closely, even if economists and investors largely are not expecting any major surprises.
On the consumer price index, economists are expecting a 0.2% monthly increase and a 2.4% annual rate; excluding food and energy, core CPI is projected at 0.3% and 2.9% respectively. On producer prices, which contracted in April, the outlook is 0.2% on headline and 0.3% on core.
The bond auctions are a little more nuanced in what the market watches. Important factors include how much primary dealers take compared to indirect bidders; the amount of bids compared to the sale amount; and the ""tail,"" or the highest accepted yield against where the security was trading on a when-issued basis prior to the sale.
The BLS will release the CPI and PPI readings at 8:30 a.m. ET on their respective dates. The auction results come out at 1 p.m. ET.
Both 10-year and 30-year debt have seen yield surges since the Fed cut in September, taking another leg up after Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement April 2.
""If you look at where yields are now relative to our global peers, we still have a relatively attractive advantage there,"" said Chip Hughey, head of fixed income at Truist Advisory Services. ""I would expect there to be pretty sturdy demand as well, especially the 10-year auction.""
Hughey expects that investors likely already have priced in the fiscal issues as well as concerns over tariffs and inflation.
""The ongoing data shows that the economy is cooling, whether it's the employment numbers or consumer demand,"" he said.

Gavin Newsom on Tuesday asked a federal judge to quickly block the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration raids.
State Attorney General Rob Bonta asked the judge to grant a temporary restraining order blocking President Donald Trump's actions by 1 p.m. PT in order to ""prevent immediate and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs.""
Without that fast relief, Trump's deployment of the military and the National Guard poses ""imminent harm to State Sovereignty, deprives the State of vital resources, escalates tensions and promotes (rather than quells) civil unrest,"" Bonta told Judge Charles Breyer in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.
""Sending trained warfighters onto the streets is unprecedented and threatens the very core of our democracy,"" Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement later Tuesday.
""Donald Trump is behaving like a tyrant, not a President,"" the governor said. ""We ask the court to immediately block these unlawful actions.""
Trump earlier Tuesday defended his decision to authorize the deployment of 4,000 federalized members of the California National Guard and about 700 Marines to Los Angeles.
""Look, if we didn't get involved right now, Los Angeles would be burning just like it was burning a number of months ago, with all the houses that were lost,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
""Los Angeles right now would be on fire, and we have it in great shape,"" he claimed.
Newsom sued Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the Pentagon on Monday, arguing that the actions taken by the federal government are stoking more civil unrest.
The lawsuit alleges that Trump broke the law when he federalized the California National Guard without the governor's consent or input, and that the move was unwarranted.

CNBC,"RFK Jr.'s firing of CDC vaccine panel undermines science, could threaten public health, experts say",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/rfk-jr-firing-of-cdc-vaccine-advisors.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 18:55:54 GMT","Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has gutted a key government panel of vaccine advisors, saying he wants to ""re-establish public confidence"" in shots.
Some health policy experts say firing the committee members will do the opposite.
""Rather than restoring public trust, his actions are simply politicizing science and vaccine policy,"" Lawrence Gostin, professor of public health law at Georgetown University, told CNBC. ""I don't know how it is possible to trust HHS anymore.""
Gostin and other experts said the move undermines science, disrupts a trusted regulatory process for shots, and could increase public distrust in both vaccinations and federal health agencies. Some experts said the firings could threaten public health, eroding already falling U.S. immunization rates against once-common childhood diseases and making the nation less equipped to grapple with new or existing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.
The potential impact on vaccine manufacturers like Moderna, Merck, Pfizer and BioNTech is less clear, but some analysts say it introduces more uncertainty to the regulatory process around shots.
Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, said Monday he is firing all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The group of independent medical and public health experts reviews vaccine data and makes crucial recommendations that determine who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other efforts.
It is the latest in a series of steps Kennedy has taken as head of HHS to dismantle decades of U.S. vaccination policy standards and chip away at the public's confidence in immunizations. Among his most recent efforts, he dropped the CDC's recommendation for routine Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children and healthy pregnant women, which also sparked outrage in the medical and science community.
While it is unclear who will replace the current panel, some experts warn that Kennedy could try to appoint members who are sympathetic to his anti-vaccine views. That could lead to politicized recommendations that highlight the harms rather than the benefits of shots or make them widely voluntary, deterring more Americans from receiving shots or vaccinating their children, according to some experts.
""It's really important that we recognize that these actions impact everyone,"" Dr. Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. ""This is not just a committee that was retired. It is a committee whose work has broad implications.""
HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on who will be appointed to the panel, and the concerns from health policy experts.
Kennedy's 'unfounded' claims and what's next
HHS on Monday did not provide a timeline for when it will appoint new members. But the agency in a release said ACIP will still hold a planned meeting from June 25 to 27. A source familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak freely, told CNBC on Monday that entirely new members will run that meeting.
In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Kennedy claimed that the current ACIP panel has been ""plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.""
But those allegations are ""completely unfounded"" and will have a ""significant negative impact on Americans of all ages,"" Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in an emailed statement.
She said ACIP is a highly qualified group of experts that has ""always operated with transparency and a commitment to protecting the public's health.""
All HHS agencies and their advisory panels have also long had rigorous policies for conflicts of interest, and there have been no related issues for years. Members of federal vaccine advisory committees are already required to comply with regulations around disclosing potential conflicts of interest.
""The secretary is using conflicts of interest as a ruse to ignore or cherry pick scientific evidence,"" Gostin said. ""ACIP members fully disclose all potential conflicts and excuse themselves from voting if there are any perceived conflicts.""
In a statement Tuesday, the American Academy of Physician Associates said it is ""imperative that the administration acts promptly to reconstruct the committee through an open and transparent process that includes diverse provider voices,"" including physician associates.
But Northeastern's Maniar said he wouldn't be surprised if Kennedy taps political appointees who share his views around vaccine science.
That could lead to recommendations that restrict who is eligible for different vaccinations or give much more leeway for individuals to decide whether to get immunized, Maniar said. He added that Kennedy's restacked panel may want to take a longer period of time to vet certain vaccines before they become available, delaying the time it takes for them to reach patients.
""It is certainly within the realm of possibility that we will see lower vaccination rates as a result of this,"" Maniar said.
That could increase the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases spreading as the U.S. is already grappling with an unprecedented measles outbreak and is heading into a summer season of more travel and crowding, according to Maniar. The new panel's recommendations will also be crucial for children as the nation approaches a new school year in the fall.
Kennedy's decision contradicts a promise he made to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, during his confirmation hearings. Kennedy told Cassidy, who cast the deciding vote to advance his nomination through the committee at that time, that he would not alter ACIP.
On Monday, Cassidy said in a post on X that the fear is now that ""ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion."" But he said he will continue to talk with Kennedy to ""ensure this is not the case.""
Impact on vaccine manufacturers
Some Wall Street analysts also said the move is a risk to vaccine manufacturers, which depend on federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC to approve and recommend their products.
""At worst, the committee could upend current recommendations for [new] and existing vaccines,"" Leerink Partners analyst Daina Graybosch said in a note Monday. But she noted that the firm can't fully quantify the impact of the move before seeing who will replace the current panel.
In a note Monday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said Kennedy's decision is ""a negative headwind"" to vaccine manufacturers, as new appointees are likely to be more critical of future recommendations.
But he said he expects ""most impacts to be broadly muted."" Seigerman pointed to Kennedy's picks to lead the FDA and its division that regulates biological products, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, noting the ultimate selection for each seat did not reflect a ""doomsday"" scenario.
FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and CBER head Vinay Prasad have so far been ""less negative for the sector than initially feared,"" he said.
""While RFK Jr.'s commentary surrounding vaccines has been consistently critical, we believe this has been well established with realistic headwinds largely priced in by the market,"" Seigerman said.","RFK Jr.'s firing of CDC vaccine panel undermines science, could threaten public health, experts say Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Some health policy experts say firing the committee members will do the opposite. ""Rather than restoring public trust, his actions are simply politicizing science and vaccine policy,"" Lawrence Gostin, professor of public health law at Georgetown University, told CNBC. ""I don't know how it is possible to trust HHS anymore."" Gostin and other experts said the move undermines science, disrupts a trusted regulatory process for shots, and could increase public distrust in both vaccinations and federal health agencies. Some experts said the firings could threaten public health, eroding already falling U.S. immunization rates against once-common childhood diseases and making the nation less equipped to grapple with new or existing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. The potential impact on vaccine manufacturers like Moderna, Merck, Pfizer and BioNTech is less clear, but some analysts say it introduces more uncertainty to the regulatory process around shots. Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, said Monday he is firing all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The group of independent medical and public health experts reviews vaccine data and makes crucial recommendations that determine who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other efforts. It is the latest in a series of steps Kennedy has taken as head of HHS to dismantle decades of U.S. vaccination policy standards and chip away at the public's confidence in immunizations. Among his most recent efforts, he dropped the CDC's recommendation for routine Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children and healthy pregnant women, which also sparked outrage in the medical and science community. While it is unclear who will replace the current panel, some experts warn that Kennedy could try to appoint members who are sympathetic to his anti-vaccine views. That could lead to politicized recommendations that highlight the harms rather than the benefits of shots or make them widely voluntary, deterring more Americans from receiving shots or vaccinating their children, according to some experts. ""It's really important that we recognize that these actions impact everyone,"" Dr. Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. ""This is not just a committee that was retired. It is a committee whose work has broad implications."" HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on who will be appointed to the panel, and the concerns from health policy experts. Kennedy's 'unfounded' claims and what's next HHS on Monday did not provide a timeline for when it will appoint new members. But the agency in a release said ACIP will still hold a planned meeting from June 25 to 27. A source familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak freely, told CNBC on Monday that entirely new members will run that meeting. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Kennedy claimed that the current ACIP panel has been ""plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine."" But those allegations are ""completely unfounded"" and will have a ""significant negative impact on Americans of all ages,"" Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in an emailed statement. She said ACIP is a highly qualified group of experts that has ""always operated with transparency and a commitment to protecting the public's health."" All HHS agencies and their advisory panels have also long had rigorous policies for conflicts of interest, and there have been no related issues for years. Members of federal vaccine advisory committees are already required to comply with regulations around disclosing potential conflicts of interest. ""The secretary is using conflicts of interest as a ruse to ignore or cherry pick scientific evidence,"" Gostin said. ""ACIP members fully disclose all potential conflicts and excuse themselves from voting if there are any perceived conflicts."" In a statement Tuesday, the American Academy of Physician Associates said it is ""imperative that the administration acts promptly to reconstruct the committee through an open and transparent process that includes diverse provider voices,"" including physician associates. But Northeastern's Maniar said he wouldn't be surprised if Kennedy taps political appointees who share his views around vaccine science. That could lead to recommendations that restrict who is eligible for different vaccinations or give much more leeway for individuals to decide whether to get immunized, Maniar said. He added that Kennedy's restacked panel may want to take a longer period of time to vet certain vaccines before they become available, delaying the time it takes for them to reach patients. ""It is certainly within the realm of possibility that we will see lower vaccination rates as a result of this,"" Maniar said. That could increase the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases spreading as the U.S. is already grappling with an unprecedented measles outbreak and is heading into a summer season of more travel and crowding, according to Maniar. The new panel's recommendations will also be crucial for children as the nation approaches a new school year in the fall. Kennedy's decision contradicts a promise he made to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, during his confirmation hearings. Kennedy told Cassidy, who cast the deciding vote to advance his nomination through the committee at that time, that he would not alter ACIP. On Monday, Cassidy said in a post on X that the fear is now that ""ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion."" But he said he will continue to talk with Kennedy to ""ensure this is not the case."" Impact on vaccine manufacturers Some Wall Street analysts also said the move is a risk to vaccine manufacturers, which depend on federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC to approve and recommend their products. ""At worst, the committee could upend current recommendations for [new] and existing vaccines,"" Leerink Partners analyst Daina Graybosch said in a note Monday. But she noted that the firm can't fully quantify the impact of the move before seeing who will replace the current panel. In a note Monday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said Kennedy's decision is ""a negative headwind"" to vaccine manufacturers, as new appointees are likely to be more critical of future recommendations. But he said he expects ""most impacts to be broadly muted."" Seigerman pointed to Kennedy's picks to lead the FDA and its division that regulates biological products, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, noting the ultimate selection for each seat did not reflect a ""doomsday"" scenario. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and CBER head Vinay Prasad have so far been ""less negative for the sector than initially feared,"" he said. ""While RFK Jr.'s commentary surrounding vaccines has been consistently critical, we believe this has been well established with realistic headwinds largely priced in by the market,"" Seigerman said.",Neutral,0.9806
CNBC,"In China, fears grow of an EV financial crisis amid pricing war",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/china-electric-vehicle-ev-pricing-war.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 18:34:47 GMT","At a used car market in Beijing, salesman Ma Hui said he fears China's electric vehicle industry is in a race to the bottom.
EV makers, led by the country's market leader BYD, have been engaged in a bruising price war, depressing profits for the brands, as well as sellers such as Ma.
""All of us were losing money last year,"" Ma said about his fellow used car sellers in the market. ""There are too many companies making too many new energy cars.""
China's trading partners have often accused the country of flooding the global market with cheap Chinese EVs. These days, similar accusations are flying within China, raising concerns about financial stress in the industry.
The official Communist Party paper, the People's Daily, for example, published a commentary on Monday, titled ""The 'Price War' In The Automotive Industry Leads Nowhere And Has No Future.""
""Disorderly 'price wars' squeeze profits across the chain, impacting the entire ecosystem and risking income declines for workers,"" the paper warned. ""Long-term, this 'race to the bottom' competition is unsustainable.""
BYD is drawing the most fire after it announced price cuts in late May for many of its models. Some of the discounts are as steep as 34%. Its cheapest car, the Seagull mini hatchback, now costs only about $7,700, down from about $10,000.
The intense price war has led high-profile auto executives to sound the alarm — with the head of Great Wall Motor calling the industry ""unhealthy.""
In an interview with Chinese news outlet Sina Finance on May 23, Great Wall Motor Chairman Wei Jianjun drew parallels to China's moribund property sector and its now defunct poster child, developer Evergrande.
""An 'Evergrande-like' crisis already exists in the automotive industry,"" he said. ""It just hasn't erupted yet.""
A government-backed industry group has also called on companies not to ""dump"" vehicles below the cost of production. In a statement, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers took a veiled swipe at BYD.
""A certain automaker has taken the lead in launching significant price cuts and many companies have followed suit, triggering a new round of 'price war' panic,"" the group said.
BYD dismissed Wei's comment as alarmist and said it believes in fair competition in response to CAAM's criticism.
In a sign of further strain, sellers at the Beijing used car market told CNBC about a phenomenon known as ""zero mileage used cars,"" which is meant to help auto manufacturers and dealers inflate sales volumes. This happens when cars are registered and plated and then marked as sold, but haven't ever been driven.
Ma said he is worried about where the fierce competition leads. He told CNBC he sees the impact of the intense competition on consumers who are already shy about spending in the down economy.

CNBC,"Snap to launch smaller, lighter augmented reality Specs smartglasses in 2026",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/snap-specs-smart-glasses-ar.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 17:10:01 GMT","Snap on Tuesday announced its plans to release a sixth-generation of its augmented reality glasses in 2026, as competition in the smart glasses market continues to heat up.
The maker of Snapchat said that its next-generation glasses will be called Specs, breaking with the company's Spectacles branding that it used for previous versions of its wearable devices. The Specs will use AR technology to let people see and interact with digital imagery that's overlaid over the physical world.
Snap did not reveal a price or exact launch date for Specs, but the new glasses will be smaller and lighter than their predecessors, the company said. Snap's most recent Spectacles were released in September 2024 to developers only. That edition of the glasses was available under a leasing model that required users to commit to paying $99 a month for a full year.
The consumer-focused Specs will run on the company's Snap OS operating systems. Snap said that developers will be able to incorporate Google's Gemini AI models into programs they develop for the smart glasses, giving coders more AI options to choose from as they write software for the device. Previously, developers could only use OpenAI's GPT family of AI models to build AR apps for the smart glasses.
""We couldn't be more excited about the extraordinary progress in artificial intelligence and augmented reality that is enabling new, human-centered computing experiences,"" Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in a statement.
When Snap launched its first Spectacles glasses in 2016, the $130 wearable was limited to simple features like helping users shoot short videos that they could post to Snapchat. The company updated its glasses with augmented reality displays in 2021 that allowed users to see virtual imagery overlaid by the glasses over what users saw in the real world.
Since then, competition in the world of head-mounted computers has grown.
Apple began selling its $3,500 Vision Pro goggles in February 2024, while Meta now has a range of cutting-edge products including Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses and the experimental Project Orion AR glasses, which the social media company showed off last fall.
Google, meanwhile, announced its own entry into the space in May when it revealed a $150 million partnership with Warby Parker, which said it will release its own smart glasses sometime after this year.","Snap to launch smaller, lighter augmented reality Specs smartglasses in 2026 Snap on Tuesday announced its plans to release a sixth-generation of its augmented reality glasses in 2026, as competition in the smart glasses market continues to heat up.

CNBC,"Immigrant framed for Trump threats can be released on bond, judge says",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/morales-reyes-trump-threat-bond.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 16:22:51 GMT","The undocumented Mexican immigrant who was detained after being framed by a jailed inmate for threatening President Donald Trump can be released on a $7,500 bond, a Chicago Immigration Court judge ruled Tuesday morning.
Judge Carla Espinoza said at a hearing that she does not believe Milwaukee resident Ramon Morales-Reyes is a danger to the community pending removal proceedings.
The judge noted that although the 54-year-old Morales-Reyes has been arrested several times since 1996, he has only been convicted once, for disorderly conduct.
An attorney representing the Department of Homeland Security did not oppose a request by the immigrant's lawyer, Cain Oulahan, requesting bond. Oulahan and Morales-Reyes appeared remotely, with the immigrant still detained in Dodge County Jail in Wisconsin.
Espinoza said that if Morales-Reyes is unable to post bond, the next hearing in the case will be on July 10, and that she would set another date if the married dad of three is released.
CNBC has requested comment from Oulahan.
DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a statement, said, ""While this criminal illegal alien is no longer under investigation for threats against the President, he is in the country illegally with previous arrests for felony hit and run, criminal damage to property, and disorderly conduct with domestic abuse.""
""The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law and fulfilling the President's mandate to deport illegal aliens. DHS will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of illegal aliens who have no right to be in this country,"" McLaughlin said.
Morales-Reyes, who has lived in the United States since 1986, was arrested May 22 on suspicion that he had written three letters to law enforcement officers in Wisconsin that threatened Trump and others.
A week later, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem touted Morales-Reyes' arrest in a news release that called the dishwasher an ""illegal alien,"" and featured his photo, as well as an image of a handwritten letter threatening to shoot ""your precious president"" Trump.
But Milwaukee police who questioned Morales-Reyes quickly realized there was a problem with the allegations against him, court records show.
First, a handwriting sample Morales-Reyes provided was ""completely different"" from the writing on the letters and the envelopes, which bore his home address as the return address, a criminal complaint says. Also, Morales-Reyes does not speak, read, or write English fluently, while the writing in the letters was in English.
When a police detective asked Morales-Reyes, ""Who would want to get [him] in trouble, [he] stated that the only person who would want to get him in [trouble] was the person who had robbed him and who law enforcement knows to be the defendant, Demetric D. Scott.""
Scott, who is detained in Milwaukee County Jail, was arrested in late 2023 for allegedly robbing Morales-Reyes and attacking him with a box cutter.
Scott, 52, told police in late May that he had written the threatening letters about Trump, and put Morales-Reyes' address on the envelopes before they were sent on his behalf by others, to get the immigrant arrested by federal authorities so that he would be unable to testify at Scott's criminal trial in July, court records state.
Scott hoped that his case would be dismissed when Morales-Reyes failed to appear in court, those records say.
Scott has been charged with identity theft, felony intimidation of a witness, and bail jumping in connection with the letters plot.
At the time Morales-Reyes was arrested, he had applied for a special type of visa available to victims of certain crimes.
The web page announcing the Morales-Reyes' arrest remains up on DHS's site, with the now discredited allegations against him.
At the bottom of that page is a ""disclaimer,"" which notes that he is no longer under investigation for threatening Trump.

In all, the 2025 Disruptors have raised $127 billion at a total implied valuation $798 billion. | 1 | Anduril | Leading a new military-technological complex | | 2 | OpenAI | Record users, record cash | | 3 | Databricks | Building blocks of intelligence | | 4 | Anthropic | The big business case for AI | | 5 | Canva | Creative visualization | | 6 | Ramp | Freeing up more finance | | 7 | Flock Safety | A crime fighter | | 8 | AlphaSense | Market intelligence | | 9 | Octopus Energy | The new power generation | | 10 | Stripe | Processing-oriented | | 11 | Revolut | British banker | | 12 | Thrive Market | A healthier shopping habit | | 13 | Metropolis | The spot to be in parking | | 14 | Transcarent | They care | | 15 | Lead Bank | Fintech's fixer | | 16 | Carbon Robotics | Weedtech | | 17 | Virta Health | What comes after GLP-1s | | 18 | Fruitist | The berry unicorn | | 19 | Saronic Technologies | In the autonomous navy | | 20 | GrubMarket | Food's supply side | | 21 | MoonPay | Moving with crypto wherever it goes | | 22 | Writer | A model worker | | 23 | ŌURA | Put a ring on it | | 24 | Einride | Self-driving semis | | 25 | Abnormal AI | Phishy business | | 26 | Iambic Therapeutics | Small molecules, big drug discoveries | | 27 | Perplexity | Search and deploy | | 28 | Scale AI | AGI's data foundry | | 29 | Rippling | Employee management reset | | 30 | Gecko Robotics | Before things break | | 31 | Footprint | Putting things in a new package | | 32 | Harvey | Lawyering up AI | | 33 | Apptronik | 5 feet 8 inches, 160 lbs, all robot | | 34 | Notion | Lego my work | | 35 | Waabi | How self-driving trucks see and learn | | 36 | Zum | A better ride to school | | 37 | Formation Bio | A lifeline for stalled drugs | | 38 | Shield AI | Drone force | | 39 | Navan | Business travel's super app | | 40 | VAST Data | The gen AI stack | | 41 | Rad AI | Radiology's new set of eyes | | 42 | Glean | Enterprising search | | 43 | ElevateBio | Domestic biotech manufacturing | | 44 | Exotec | The robot warehouse rise | | 45 | Figma | The redesigner | | 46 | Zipline | Frequent drone flyer | | 47 | Abridge | Getting a doctor's note | | 48 | Sierra | Chatting you up | | 49 | Esusu | Treating renters like owners | | 50 | Runway | Lights, camera, gen AI |",Neutral,0.9999
CNBC,"What's next for Oura Ring in personal health and fitness monitoring, according to CEO Tom Hale",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/oura-ring-health-fitness-monitoring-devices.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 17:27:23 GMT","When the idea for the Oura Ring was first spawned in 2013, the company's founders envisioned a device that would take a precise look at sleep and recovery, two important aspects of overall health that they felt few wearable tools had prioritized to that point.
Now, over a decade later, Oura's ambitions have evolved to transform healthcare and personal health, all while disrupting the growing wearables industry.
""The vision for the future of Oura has to do with the doctor in your pocket,"" Oura CEO Tom Hale said in an appearance on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Tuesday. ""Everyone already has kind of a supercomputer in their pocket — everyone should have a wearable device which is monitoring them continuously that just fits into their life, and then a machine intelligence which is overlooking them to provide them preventative personal care to help them live their best and healthiest life.""
Oura, which was ranked No. 23 on the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, has hastened its shift towards broader health monitoring through a combination of technological upgrades, product advances, fundraising, acquisitions, and the usage of AI, LLMs and analytics. That has helped the company broaden its vision from just sleep to cardiovascular health, stress & resilience, women's health, and now nutrition and eating habits.
It also means evolving beyond tracking things just with a ring, leading Oura into new partnerships with companies like Dexcom, one of the leaders in glucose biosensing via its glucose monitor, and through features like an AI health coach and the ability to take pictures of your food and upload it into the app for nutrition breakdowns and AI-driven advice.
While that pushes Oura further into a broader wearables category competing alongside more all-in-one devices like watches from Apple, Google and Samsung, as well as focused fitness devices from companies like Garmin and Whoop, Hale said that the rest of the category ""pushes us to go further and farther ahead in creating innovations that are going to blow people's minds.""
""We're really focused on the things that matter that are going to change your health picture,"" he said.
Hale said he believes one of the biggest competitors Oura faces is ""people just not being aware of the benefits"" of wearing the ring, but the company's increased focus on overall health and wellness is resonating with consumers.
In June 2024, Oura announced that it had sold more than 2.5 million rings. Now, about a year later, Hale said the company has ""roughly doubled the business, and we continue to grow.""
Hale said the company had previously announced it was going to do about $500 million in revenue last year, and this year ""it's definitely going to be a lot larger than last year.""
While that doesn't mean an IPO is on the horizon — Hale said the company has ""some catching up to do before we're ready to be a public company"" — Oura sees plenty of room ahead to continue to lean into what its ring wearers are increasingly looking for.
""We see a world where you might be using some sensor for some amount of time to learn some lesson, but the device you're going to have on your body to monitor your sleep, your activity, your overall health [and] make predictions about your health, will be the Oura Ring,"" Hale said.

There have been some unnerving days amid the Trump administration's tariff policies. The S&P 500 dropped by 2% or more on six days between Jan. 20 and June 6, according to data provided to CNBC by Morningstar Direct. During that period, there were 18 days where the index shed 1% or more.
Still, the S&P 500's annualized return for Trump's second presidency is positive, at 1.58%, Morningstar Direct found.
With more market swings on the horizon amid threats of a worsening trade war and warning signs in the labor market, the numbers serve up an old lesson for investors: When the market is freaking out, it pays to stay calm.
""I always remind clients that volatility doesn't predict direction,"" said Cathy Curtis, the founder of Curtis Financial Planning in Oakland, California. She is a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.
Other early presidential terms led to bigger returns
Investors have reaped bigger returns in the early days of previous presidents.
The S&P 500's annualized return was over 34% in the roughly first five months of former President Joe Biden's tenure, Morningstar Direct calculated. Meanwhile, the index was up around 30% during that same period in former president Barack Obama's first and second term.
But there have been worse starts to recent presidencies than Trump's second term, as well.
The S&P 500 had a negative annualized return of about 12% during former President George W. Bush's first term, up until June 6, 2001. There were also 23 days in those first months for Bush where the S&P 500 declined 1% or more.
""Sharp daily declines can test resolve, but the market's resilience highlights the peril of impulsive exits during turbulence,"" said Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and the founder of Bone Fide Wealth. He is also a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.
An 'unmistakable' long-term trend
In practice, investors want to keep their money in the market over decades, and many presidencies.
Almost all presidential terms since President Jimmy Carter saw healthy stock market returns for the full four or eight years, Mark Motley, portfolio manager at Foster & Motley in Cincinnati, wrote in a pre-election market update. The exception: President George W. Bush, due to the Great Recession.
Foster & Motley is No. 34 on the 2024 CNBC Financial Advisor 100 list.
To prove that point to clients, Curtis will show a chart of the S&P 500 going back to 1950.
For example, if you invested $1,000 in the index on Jan. 20, 1950, when Harry S. Truman was president, you'd have around $3.8 million as of the market's close on June 6 of this year, Morningstar Direct found.

Part of the company's plan involves the new IBM Quantum Nighthawk processor, which is set to release later this year, according to a blog post announcing the details.
""Unlocking the full promise of quantum computing will require a device capable of running larger, deeper circuits with hundreds of millions of gates operating on hundreds of qubits, at least,"" the company said in a blog post. ""More than that, it will require a device capable of correcting errors and preventing them from spreading throughout the system. ... it will require a fault-tolerant quantum computer.
Fault tolerance refers to the system's ability to correct and deal with errors.
The quantum race accelerated this year after Google announced its breakthrough quantum chip ""Willow"" in December. Microsoft rolled out its first quantum chip Majorana 1 in February, and Amazon followed a week later with its ""Ocelot"" chip.
Quantum computing has received more attention and investment in recent years as experts say they are getting closer to a device that can actually solve problems faster than a traditional computer based on semiconductors.
Researchers say a working quantum computer will be a useful tool to simulate complicated physics or do math that could decipher encrypted data.
Quantum Starling will be built at the IBM Poughkeepsie Lab in New York.
IBM's new roadmap sets a timeline for building the components needed in the build, with a series of processors and adapters all named with the bird theme.
This year the company is building the Quantum Loon chip, followed by the Quantum Kookaburra, a quantum processor module, in 2026, the blog post said. The Quantum Cockatoo adapter is set for 2027.
The Quantum Nighthawk processor will replace the company's Quantum Heron processor, the company said in the post. IBM said Nighthawk can run quantum circuits with 5,000 gates, like the Heron, but plans to boost it to 15,000 gates by 2028.

CNBC,Why the Switch 2 is so important for Nintendo,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/why-the-switch-2-is-so-important-for-nintendo.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 12:00:01 GMT","Nintendo just released the Switch 2, its first new game console in eight years. The original Switch was wildly popular, selling 15 million units in its first year, more than any prior Nintendo console. The company says its was the second most successful console in its history.
The Switch also beat out the competition, topping consoles from Microsoft and Sony in first-year sales. Overall, it was only surpassed by the PlayStation 2, the best-selling console of all time.
""The Switch replaced both the historic Nintendo console and the historic Nintendo handheld,"" says Michael Pachter, managing director at Wedbush Securities. ""They've merged those two audiences, and the handheld audience got a massive trade up, and the console audience got a zero trade down.""
While Nintendo systems have often introduced bold new features, like Wii's motion controls or the DS' touch screen, the Switch 2 may be the company's biggest bet yet: that consumers want more of the same. When the original Switch was released in 2017, it met the quality gamers expected from a home console on the go. The second iteration builds off the success of the innovative device, with a bigger screen, improved performance and a higher price tag at $450.
Still, the Switch 2 sold out within minutes of pre-orders opening up. And fans lined up for hours ahead of the midnight release at Nintendo stores. The company says it expects to sell 15 million units of the new console in its first year.
""They're probably not going to be in a position to meet initial demand,"" said Clay Griffin, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. ""I do think that they'll be able to have success even at this higher price point…there's enough demand that they should be fine.""
When asked what makes the Switch 2 a worthwhile upgrade, Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser told CNBC it's about creating the next generation of gaming platforms that enhances the overall gameplay for consumers.
""With Switch 2, we've taken the things you know and love about Nintendo Switch, but then added very powerful gameplay features and social features,"" he said.

CNBC,Why BlackRock's smallest deal of 2024 may end up being its most consequential,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/blackrocks-smallest-deal-of-2024-may-end-up-being-its-most-consequential.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 18:15:30 GMT","BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has sent a clear message to investors: The world's largest asset manager's smallest acquisition last year could end up its most consequential. During an industry conference in March, the long-time executive said BlackRock's $3.2 billion purchase of alternatives asset data provider Preqin — its smallest of the four deals announced in 2024 — is ""probably the most significant thing we have done in terms of expanding the profile of private markets."" It could be a big deal for investors, too. For starters, Preqin can bring what BlackRock currently does best — offer investors index products like exchange-traded funds (ETF) for public markets — to the opaque world of private markets. That would add revenue and earnings diversification that's less tied to the daily fluctuations of the stock and bond markets, BlackRock CFO Martin Small said when announcing the deal in July 2024. ""Through strong organic growth and scaling of our private markets and investment technology platforms, both of which fuel stable earnings growth,"" Small added. ""We believe we can drive multiple expansion for our shareholders."" BLK YTD mountain BlackRock (BLK) year-to-date performance The acquisition, which closed on March 3 , integrates Preqin's private markets data into BlackRock platforms such as its portfolio management system Aladdin and investment software eFront. This gives BlackRock clients – mostly institutional investors who pay for access to these platforms – more visibility into non-public investment areas like infrastructure, private equity, private credit, and more. They will get valuation and performance data on more than 190,000 funds and 60,000 managers, according to BlackRock. ""Preqin effectively does for private markets what Zillow did for housing,"" CEO Fink said in his 2025 annual chairman letter . ""If you're buying a home, you want to know if you're paying a fair price, and there are ways to do that. You can check neighborhood benchmarks, recent sales, or historical appreciation trends; companies like Zillow have made this simple. But today, investing in private markets feels a bit like buying a house in an unfamiliar neighborhood before Zillow existed, where finding accurate prices was difficult or impossible."" ""This lack of transparency discourages investment,"" he added. The new venture could take some of the pressure off BlackRock's index business, which manages trillions of dollars and makes up a significant portion of its overall revenues. Although the firm has profited immensely as a traditional asset manager and has become an industry leader for ETFs, the division's revenue streams are still at the mercy of the stock market's volatility. BlackRock also has to pay fees to third-party providers like S & P Global and MSCI to use their underlying data in BlackRock funds. The longer-term goal is for BlackRock to create its own private-market benchmarks and sell more accessible private index products. Fink has also said private market investments could play a role within retirement accounts like IRAs, touting them as offering higher returns. ""Not that we're making a pivot, we just see the blending of public and private markets coming together and [it's] probably happening faster than I ever envisioned,"" Fink said at RBC Global Financial Institutions Conference in March. There are signs that the Preqin deal is already starting to pay off. Preqin added roughly $20 million to first-quarter revenue — even though it was owned for less than a third of the period — and contributed to the firm's 30% year-over-year increase in annual contract values, or ACV, Small said during the company's April earnings call. The CFO said this new ""growth reflects sustained demand"" from Preqin and that the trend shouldn't die down anytime time. ""We remain committed to low to mid-teens ACV growth over the long term,"" he said. ACV is a financial metric that represents the average annual revenue from a customer contract. Offering retail investors access to private market investments doesn't come without risk. Moody's has warned that selling funds to retail investors could result in ""reputation loss, heightened regulatory scrutiny and higher costs"" for asset managers, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. ""If growth outpaces the industry's ability to manage such complexities, such challenges could have systemic consequences,"" Moody's analysts wrote. However, in his annual chairman letter, Fink wrote that ""private markets don't have to be as risky. Or opaque. Or out of reach."" He added: ""Not if the investment industry is willing to innovate—and that's exactly what we've spent the past year doing at BlackRock."" There's more to like about the Preqin acquisition. The deal should attract more clients and deepen its existing relationships. The competition for private markets data providers is limited, and Preqin has one of the most comprehensive data sets available. That could result in more valuable contracts with its existing clients and an increase in sales. We see this in the impact of similar acquisitions on BlackRock's financials. Since BlackRock's eFront acquisition in 2019, for example, BlackRock has doubled the annual contract value of the business. As these BlackRock platforms get bigger and integrate more data, they should retain customers and lure new ones in from rival asset managers. ""In our thesis about demand for a whole portfolio view combining Aladdin and eFront capabilities, it's driven new sales for both Aladdin and eFront,"" Small said last July. ""We'll look to repeat this success with Preqin and have a business plan that we believe can generate significant synergies resulting in an 18% [internal rate of return]."" Better client relationships also means Preqin can create a flywheel effect within BlackRock. Clients who use Preqin could be more inclined to tap BlackRock for its other services as well. ""Preqin just makes [these platforms] better and crowds out competition and drives growth in all [BlackRock's] businesses,"" Evercore analyst Glenn Schorr told CNBC recently. ""What's probably even more appealing to this amazing asset manager is the insights [Preqin] can bring on where and how it can grow in the future as an asset manager, and then the value that [the deal] can bring to their large LPs that they manage money for,"" Schorr said. ""I think that's the mindset that Larry probably had when he was talking about how important of a business this could be for them."" And lastly, BlackRock's Preqin buy further expands the firm into the fast-growing world of private markets, which have grown enormously over the past several years as investors look for alternatives. It follows the firm's other recent moves in the space. BlackRock closed a $12.5 billion deal for infrastructure investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners in October. The firm is also expected to complete its purchase of private credit manager HPS Investment Partners for $12 billion as well in 2025. ""There are few people that would disagree that private markets are a continued very large growth opportunity for any good asset manager, any good wealth management firm [or] any good bank as well,"" Schorr said.

During an industry conference in March, the long-time executive said BlackRock's $3.2 billion purchase of alternatives asset data provider Preqin — its smallest of the four deals announced in 2024 — is ""probably the most significant thing we have done in terms of expanding the profile of private markets."" It could be a big deal for investors, too. For starters, Preqin can bring what BlackRock currently does best — offer investors index products like exchange-traded funds (ETF) for public markets — to the opaque world of private markets. That would add revenue and earnings diversification that's less tied to the daily fluctuations of the stock and bond markets, BlackRock CFO Martin Small said when announcing the deal in July 2024. ""Through strong organic growth and scaling of our private markets and investment technology platforms, both of which fuel stable earnings growth,"" Small added. ""We believe we can drive multiple expansion for our shareholders."" BLK YTD mountain BlackRock (BLK) year-to-date performance The acquisition, which closed on March 3 , integrates Preqin's private markets data into BlackRock platforms such as its portfolio management system Aladdin and investment software eFront. This gives BlackRock clients – mostly institutional investors who pay for access to these platforms – more visibility into non-public investment areas like infrastructure, private equity, private credit, and more. They will get valuation and performance data on more than 190,000 funds and 60,000 managers, according to BlackRock. ""Preqin effectively does for private markets what Zillow did for housing,"" CEO Fink said in his 2025 annual chairman letter . ""If you're buying a home, you want to know if you're paying a fair price, and there are ways to do that. You can check neighborhood benchmarks, recent sales, or historical appreciation trends; companies like Zillow have made this simple. But today, investing in private markets feels a bit like buying a house in an unfamiliar neighborhood before Zillow existed, where finding accurate prices was difficult or impossible."" ""This lack of transparency discourages investment,"" he added. The new venture could take some of the pressure off BlackRock's index business, which manages trillions of dollars and makes up a significant portion of its overall revenues. Although the firm has profited immensely as a traditional asset manager and has become an industry leader for ETFs, the division's revenue streams are still at the mercy of the stock market's volatility. BlackRock also has to pay fees to third-party providers like S & P Global and MSCI to use their underlying data in BlackRock funds. The longer-term goal is for BlackRock to create its own private-market benchmarks and sell more accessible private index products. Fink has also said private market investments could play a role within retirement accounts like IRAs, touting them as offering higher returns. ""Not that we're making a pivot, we just see the blending of public and private markets coming together and [it's] probably happening faster than I ever envisioned,"" Fink said at RBC Global Financial Institutions Conference in March. There are signs that the Preqin deal is already starting to pay off. Preqin added roughly $20 million to first-quarter revenue — even though it was owned for less than a third of the period — and contributed to the firm's 30% year-over-year increase in annual contract values, or ACV, Small said during the company's April earnings call. The CFO said this new ""growth reflects sustained demand"" from Preqin and that the trend shouldn't die down anytime time. ""We remain committed to low to mid-teens ACV growth over the long term,"" he said. ACV is a financial metric that represents the average annual revenue from a customer contract. Offering retail investors access to private market investments doesn't come without risk. Moody's has warned that selling funds to retail investors could result in ""reputation loss, heightened regulatory scrutiny and higher costs"" for asset managers, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. ""If growth outpaces the industry's ability to manage such complexities, such challenges could have systemic consequences,"" Moody's analysts wrote. However, in his annual chairman letter, Fink wrote that ""private markets don't have to be as risky. Or opaque. Or out of reach."" He added: ""Not if the investment industry is willing to innovate—and that's exactly what we've spent the past year doing at BlackRock."" There's more to like about the Preqin acquisition. The deal should attract more clients and deepen its existing relationships. The competition for private markets data providers is limited, and Preqin has one of the most comprehensive data sets available. That could result in more valuable contracts with its existing clients and an increase in sales. We see this in the impact of similar acquisitions on BlackRock's financials. Since BlackRock's eFront acquisition in 2019, for example, BlackRock has doubled the annual contract value of the business. As these BlackRock platforms get bigger and integrate more data, they should retain customers and lure new ones in from rival asset managers. ""In our thesis about demand for a whole portfolio view combining Aladdin and eFront capabilities, it's driven new sales for both Aladdin and eFront,"" Small said last July. ""We'll look to repeat this success with Preqin and have a business plan that we believe can generate significant synergies resulting in an 18% [internal rate of return]."" Better client relationships also means Preqin can create a flywheel effect within BlackRock. Clients who use Preqin could be more inclined to tap BlackRock for its other services as well. ""Preqin just makes [these platforms] better and crowds out competition and drives growth in all [BlackRock's] businesses,"" Evercore analyst Glenn Schorr told CNBC recently.

CNBC,World Bank sharply cuts global growth outlook on trade turbulence,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/world-bank-cuts-2025-growth-outlook-to-2point3percent-as-trade-tariffs-weigh.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 15:24:58 GMT","The World Bank sharply cut its global economic growth projections Tuesday, citing disruption from trade uncertainty in particular.
It now expects the global economy to expand by 2.3% in 2025, down from an earlier forecast of 2.7%.
""This would mark the slowest rate of global growth since 2008, aside from outright global recessions,"" the Bank said in its Global Economic Prospects report.
Trade uncertainty, especially, has weighed on the outlook, the World Bank suggested.
""International discord — about trade, in particular — has upended many of the policy certainties that helped shrink extreme poverty and expand prosperity after the end of World War II,"" Indermit Gill, senior vice president and chief economist of The World Bank Group, said in the report.
It also cut its 2025 growth forecast for the U.S. by 0.9 percentage points to 1.4%, and reduced its euro area GDP expectations by 0.3 percentage points to 0.7%.
The Bank noted that an escalation of trade tensions could push growth even lower, but the picture could improve if major economies strike lasting trade agreements.
""Our analysis suggests that if today's trade disputes were resolved with agreements that halve tariffs relative to their levels in late May, 2025, global growth could be stronger by about 0.2 percentage point on average over the course of 2025 and 2026,"" Gill said.
The U.S. and many of its trading partners are currently in negotiations after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on numerous countries in April. This week, for example, the U.S. and China are meeting in London after the two countries agreed to temporarily reduce levies following talks in May.
Negotiations are also still ongoing between the U.S. and European Union with less than a month to go before previously announced tariffs are set to come into full force.
In cutting its global growth expectation, the World Bank follows various other bodies, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which also cited the fallout from trade and tariff-related uncertainty as the key factor.
The OECD said earlier this month that it was expecting global growth to slow to 2.9% in 2025, also caveating its forecast with the potential for future tariff developments. It had previously forecast global growth of 3.1% this year.","World Bank sharply cuts global growth outlook on trade turbulence The World Bank sharply cut its global economic growth projections Tuesday, citing disruption from trade uncertainty in particular.

CNBC,"FanDuel adds 50-cent surcharge on Illinois bets to offset state taxes, DraftKings may follow",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/fanduel-draftkings-surcharge-illinois-taxes.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 15:55:50 GMT","FanDuel is upping the ante in Illinois with a new 50-cent surcharge on all wagers, and DraftKings may be next.
Flutter-owned FanDuel is introducing the charge to mitigate the impact of new taxes that the state instituted with its new budget, which disproportionately affect the two leading sportsbooks.
The new tax is applied to each wager that a sportsbook accepts — 25 cents per bet for the first 20 million wagers, 50 cents per wager after that.
""Should the state reverse its decision at any point in the future, FanDuel will immediately remove the $0.50 transaction fee,"" Flutter said in a press release.
DraftKings may be following suit. In a statement issued on Tuesday, a company spokesperson said, ""DraftKings anticipates taking action and expects to share more information soon.""
Combined, FanDuel and DraftKings account for about 75% of the Illinois sports betting market.
Citizens gaming analyst Jordan Bender estimates the new transaction fee will translate to $79 million in new 2026 revenue for DraftKings, or 5.4% of its projected EBITDA for that year, and $86 million for FanDuel, about 2% of EBITDA.
The Illinois tax comes on top of a progressive tax passed last year, which leaves the most successful sportsbooks paying taxes at a rate of 40%. Before the change, they were paying at 15%.
When that tax bill passed, DraftKings initially said it would pass along the costs to consumers. After massive backlash, it reversed course.
Now FanDuel has picked up the gauntlet to manage the impact.
""It is important to recognize that there is an optimal level for gaming tax rates that enables operators to provide the best experience for customers, maximize market growth and maximize revenue for states over time. We are disappointed that the Illinois Transaction Fee will disproportionately impact lower wagering,"" said Flutter Entertainment CEO Peter Jackson in a statement.
There are a number of other state legislatures considering raising their own tax rates, including New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Jackson said the tax disproportionately punishes the companies that have invested the most in growing the regulated market, adding the fee will motivate gamblers to head to unregulated operators who don't pay taxes and don't have the same consumer protection.
And he said, the tax most affects recreational customers who make small bets.

The allure of general-purpose AI, the kind championed by tech giants, is undeniable. But for finance, a realm of intricate regulations and specialized jargon, this approach is a dangerous mirage.
It's time for a reality check: finance needs its own AI, not a one-size-fits-all solution.
The idea that a generalized large language model (LLM) can seamlessly navigate the complexities of wealth management, asset management, or insurance is fundamentally flawed. These are domains with their own jargon, private data, specialized workflows and intermediaries, akin to healthcare or law.
A model trained on broad internet data will struggle with the precision required for financial calculations and regulatory compliance. Nor will it infer the multi-step process to navigate decision trees unless provided a framework.
Models fine tuned using private, public and user generated real world data and further enhanced by synthetic or simulated data using foundational large (and sometimes small) language models, for specific use cases using knowledge graphs and detailed workflow schemas to enable reasoning will soon determine the quality of your AI application in finance.
Extracting language from a document is one thing; reasoning and interacting with a specialist in a finance context, with its unique methodologies and schemas, is another. This leads to a natural inference: even the hyperscale horizontal players — the Microsofts and Amazons — and the application developers — the Salesforces and Palantirs of the world — need specialized collaborators in finance. Their generalist AI platforms, while powerful, lack the necessary domain expertise.
Specialized AI
The depth required in areas like wealth management and asset management is simply too granular. These leaders will inevitably need to collaborate with industry specialists who possess the intimate knowledge of workflows, regulations, and user experiences in finance.
The era of bulldozing LLMs through domains is over. The future lies in verticalization, where specialized AI is built in collaboration with experts who understand the intricacies of the financial world. This vertical of complex financial services is also large enough to justify these partnerships. At the same time, traditional financial service firms need to abandon the hubris of using these general platforms to build in-house. The initial impulse to build and own the technology due to domain expertise is understandable — sometimes because vendors are not mature or stable enough in an emerging industry. But this is a costly and often futile endeavor.
The AI landscape is evolving at breakneck speed. What's cutting-edge today is outdated tomorrow. This requires repeated reassessments, a culture of clean sheet thinking and an organizational design that rewards speed. Financial institutions risk getting trapped in a perpetual cycle of development and maintenance, diverting resources from their core business. If a use case is common to the industry, chances are that a fintech focused on that use case will build, scale, learn and maintain its way to a better product faster than an internal team can.
A relevant parallel is the early evolution of CRM systems: trying to build your own in-house solution in the early 2000s when specialized partners emerged is now clearly proven to have been shortsighted. In some cases, where the firm is large — e.g. a JPMorgan or a Morgan Stanley — and has the resources to deploy towards building internal teams tackling use cases unique to them, this may make sense. It may also make sense if the platform is being used to generate and enhance their core intellectual property. Assuming that they can move fast.
As a result, for the generalist technology players as well as for the incumbent financial service firms, the smart move is to embrace partnerships. Firms should focus on what makes them unique — their special sauce — and let emergent fintechs handle the complementary heavy lifting.
In conclusion, the financial world must recognize that its AI needs are distinct. It needs specialized solutions. It needs more strategic partnerships between tech giants and finance experts. It needs traditional firms to resist an isolationist go-it-alone approach. The stakes are high. Generalist technology firms and specialized financial incumbents: beware.

It's time for a reality check: finance needs its own AI, not a one-size-fits-all solution. The idea that a generalized large language model (LLM) can seamlessly navigate the complexities of wealth management, asset management, or insurance is fundamentally flawed. These are domains with their own jargon, private data, specialized workflows and intermediaries, akin to healthcare or law. A model trained on broad internet data will struggle with the precision required for financial calculations and regulatory compliance. Nor will it infer the multi-step process to navigate decision trees unless provided a framework. Models fine tuned using private, public and user generated real world data and further enhanced by synthetic or simulated data using foundational large (and sometimes small) language models, for specific use cases using knowledge graphs and detailed workflow schemas to enable reasoning will soon determine the quality of your AI application in finance. Extracting language from a document is one thing; reasoning and interacting with a specialist in a finance context, with its unique methodologies and schemas, is another. This leads to a natural inference: even the hyperscale horizontal players — the Microsofts and Amazons — and the application developers — the Salesforces and Palantirs of the world — need specialized collaborators in finance. Their generalist AI platforms, while powerful, lack the necessary domain expertise. Specialized AI The depth required in areas like wealth management and asset management is simply too granular. These leaders will inevitably need to collaborate with industry specialists who possess the intimate knowledge of workflows, regulations, and user experiences in finance. The era of bulldozing LLMs through domains is over. The future lies in verticalization, where specialized AI is built in collaboration with experts who understand the intricacies of the financial world. This vertical of complex financial services is also large enough to justify these partnerships. At the same time, traditional financial service firms need to abandon the hubris of using these general platforms to build in-house. The initial impulse to build and own the technology due to domain expertise is understandable — sometimes because vendors are not mature or stable enough in an emerging industry. But this is a costly and often futile endeavor. The AI landscape is evolving at breakneck speed. What's cutting-edge today is outdated tomorrow. This requires repeated reassessments, a culture of clean sheet thinking and an organizational design that rewards speed. Financial institutions risk getting trapped in a perpetual cycle of development and maintenance, diverting resources from their core business. If a use case is common to the industry, chances are that a fintech focused on that use case will build, scale, learn and maintain its way to a better product faster than an internal team can. A relevant parallel is the early evolution of CRM systems: trying to build your own in-house solution in the early 2000s when specialized partners emerged is now clearly proven to have been shortsighted. In some cases, where the firm is large — e.g. a JPMorgan or a Morgan Stanley — and has the resources to deploy towards building internal teams tackling use cases unique to them, this may make sense. It may also make sense if the platform is being used to generate and enhance their core intellectual property. Assuming that they can move fast. As a result, for the generalist technology players as well as for the incumbent financial service firms, the smart move is to embrace partnerships. Firms should focus on what makes them unique — their special sauce — and let emergent fintechs handle the complementary heavy lifting. In conclusion, the financial world must recognize that its AI needs are distinct. It needs specialized solutions. It needs more strategic partnerships between tech giants and finance experts. It needs traditional firms to resist an isolationist go-it-alone approach. The stakes are high. Generalist technology firms and specialized financial incumbents: beware.

CNBC,"Glean, gen AI enterprise search startup, raises $150 million in deal adding billions to valuation",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/glean-gen-ai-search-startup-raises-150-million-at-7-billion-value.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 15:00:01 GMT","Generative AI enterprise search startup Glean announced on Tuesday that it raised $150 million in a Series F financing, pushing up its valuation from investors by billions of dollars in less than a year, to $7.2 billion.
The company's last fundraising in September 2024 valued Glean at $4.6 billion.
On Tuesday, Glean was also named to the CNBC Disruptor 50 list for the second-consecutive year.
Glean reported that its annual recurring revenue surpassed $100 million in its last fiscal year, ending Jan. 31, 2025 — less than three years after it was launched by a founding team that includes veterans from Google, Meta, and Dropbox.
""We're building the platform that brings AI into the fabric of everyday work, connecting people to knowledge, automating tasks, and enabling smarter decisions across the enterprise,"" said Arvind Jain, Glean co-founder and CEO, in a release announcing the deal.
In early 2025, Glean launched its agentic AI, Glean Agents, which the company says are on pace to support one billion agent actions by year-end.
The company's core product is an AI-powered enterprise search platform that integrates with a wide array of workplace apps — Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, and Salesforce. Glean uses natural language understanding and machine learning to create a personalized knowledge graph for each user, improving enterprise search results and the ability to generate content, while automating individual workflows and corporate processes. While initially focused on tech industry customers, Glean has expanded to finance, retail and manufacturing.
Jain told Deirdre Bosa, anchor of CNBC's ""TechCheck,"" that the capital will allow Glean to double the size of teams in R&D and sales as it pushes further into the large enterprise market, overseas markets, and into more partnerships similar to recent ones with companies including fellow Disruptor Databricks, Snowflake and Palo Alto Networks.
Jain said for many large enterprises across sectors of the economy, the gen AI boom is as much about concern as it is about excitement. ""Large enterprises are more worried about this. They don't want to be left behind,"" he told CNBC. ""The most important thing that I hear from businesses is they are trying to make sure that their workforce becomes AI-first,"" he added.
Wellington Management led the fundraising, with existing investors Capital One Ventures, Altimeter, Citi, Coatue, DST Global, General Catalyst, ICONIQ Growth, IVP, Kleiner Parkins, Latitude Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sapphire Ventures and Sequoia Capital, all participating in the deal. New investors included Khosla Ventures, Bicycle Capital, Geodesic and Archerman Capital.
While consumer-facing gen AI is growing the fastest — OpenAI says it is adding millions of users an hour, and on Monday reported annual recurring revenue above $10 billion — Jain said the enterprise market has to be thought of in distinct terms. ""You have to remember that models like ChatGPT, they don't know anything about your internal company's data,"" he said. ""We're able to actually use that context and combine it with the power of models to solve real business problems for you.""
OpenAI does have its own enterprise business, which recently passed the three-million user mark.
While Glean has seen exponential growth in recent years, it will continue to face challenges in a competitive market including Microsoft 365 Copilot, Amazon Q Business and ChatGPT Enterprise, along with offerings from fellow Disruptors Perplexity and Writer. Jain said in some cases its technology is not in competition with, but complementing the large language models being developed for the enterprise, such as fellow Disruptor Anthropic's Claude.
But the competition is intensifying from all sides and overlapping. ""Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, they all want to actually come into this space that we started,"" Jain said. ""We have a lead. We have deep enterprise technology that we built over these years. ... We have to keep innovating. And the good thing for Glean is that we're not building a product that's going to get commoditized,"" he said.
Currently based in Palo Alto, the company will soon be opening a new office in San Francisco to support its growth.

CNBC,"Disney to pay Comcast $438.7 million to take full control of Hulu, ending lengthy valuation process",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/disney-comcast-hulu-valuation.html,"Mon, 09 Jun 2025 21:29:43 GMT","Disney has agreed to pay Comcast $438.7 million for its stake in the streaming service Hulu, concluding a years-long appraisal process.
In 2023 Disney announced it intended to buy Comcast's 33% stake in Hulu. At the time, Disney paid $8.6 billion, which reflected Hulu's guaranteed minimum value of $27.5 billion. The two companies had agreed on that floor in 2019.
Disney's announcement came as no surprise as it was widely reported by CNBC and others that Disney was looking to take full ownership of Hulu. Disney took two-thirds ownership of Hulu when it acquired Fox Corp.'s entertainment assets.
Following that initial payment, Disney and Comcast entered into an appraisal process that was originally expected to conclude in 2024.
Disney said its appraiser had reached a valuation below the guaranteed floor, while the appraiser for Comcast's NBCUniversal ""arrived at a valuation substantially in excess of the guaranteed floor value."" The process was concluded by a third appraiser on Monday, according to an SEC filing.
The final transaction is expected to close on or before July 24. Disney will record the payment in its ""net income attributable to noncontrolling interests,"" which will then reduce ""net income attributable to Disney"" in its fiscal third quarter income statement. It's not expected to impact Disney's prior guidance for fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings.
""We are pleased this is finally resolved. We have had a productive partnership with NBCUniversal, and we wish them the best of luck,"" said Disney CEO Bob Iger in a statement.
Iger added that the completed acquisition paves the way for ""a deeper and more seamless integration"" of Hulu and Disney+ content, as well as the upcoming ESPN direct-to-consumer streaming app, called ESPN.
Disney has already begun integrating the two existing services, which are also offered together in a bundle with ESPN+, the current sports streaming offering.
Comcast's NBCUniversal has been focused on building up its streaming service, Peacock, since it launched in 2020.
""Hulu was a great start for us in streaming that generated nearly $10 billion in proceeds for Comcast and created an important audience for NBCUniversal's world-class content,"" a Comcast spokesperson said in a statement Monday. ""We wish Disney well with Hulu and appreciate the cooperative way our teams managed the partnership.""
Hulu had more than 50 million subscribers as of March 29, according to Disney's most recent earnings report. In total, Disney had 180.7 million streaming subscribers, the bulk of which come from Disney+. Comcast reported in April that Peacock had 41 million subscribers.

CNBC,China’s rare-earth mineral squeeze puts defense giants in the crosshairs,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/chinas-rare-earth-squeeze-puts-defense-giants-in-the-crosshairs.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 12:30:50 GMT","The automotive and robotics industries have been hit particularly hard by China's rare earth export restrictions in recent weeks, but analysts warn Western defense giants will also feel the heat.
Top U.S. and Chinese officials are resuming trade talks in London for a second consecutive day on Tuesday, pushing to de-escalate tensions over rare-earth minerals and advanced technology.
The White House has signaled a willingness to ease chip export controls if Beijing accelerates rare earth exports, boosting investor hopes of a breakthrough. Both sides have accused each other of reneging on a preliminary trade deal struck in Geneva last month.
China's Ministry of Commerce in early April imposed export restrictions on several rare earth elements and magnets widely used in the automotive and defense sectors. The curbs were part of a response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff increase on Beijing's exported products.
National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on Monday told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that he expected a deal on rare earths to be struck quickly.
""So, our expectation is that ... immediately after the handshake any export controls from the U.S. will be eased, and the rare earths will be released in volume, and then we can go back to negotiating smaller matters,"" Hassett said.

China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, producing roughly 60% of the world's supply of rare earths and processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from other countries and processing them.
U.S. officials have previously warned that this dominance poses a strategic challenge amid the pivot to more sustainable energy sources.
William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said it appeared some progress had been made on the first day of U.S.-China trade talks, but it remains ""absolutely vital"" to achieve a further breakthrough on rare earth policy.
""We've seen some relaxation over the weekend with licenses granted in sectors connected with robotics and electric vehicles, but if you take, for example, a critical mineral like samarium, within magnets, that's absolutely essential for F-35 fighter jet construction in the U.S,"" Bain told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Tuesday.
""They can't make them without that. And not having access to that is severely affecting both U.S. construction in that area, but also perhaps its national security if that remains in place,"" he added.
Shares of some European defense giants were trading lower on Tuesday afternoon. German tank gearbox manufacturer Renk tumbled nearly 8% to lead losses on the pan-European Stoxx 600 index. Sweden's Saab fell 5% and Germany's Rheinmetall traded 2.4% lower.
CNBC has contacted the U.S. Department of Defense and the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, for comment.
'Front line of impact'
The restrictions imposed by China's Ministry of Commerce in early April require firms to apply for a license for the export of rare earths and magnets.
Rare earth elements play an integral role in modern defense technologies, according to the SFA-Oxford consultancy, enabling advanced radar and sonar systems, laser guidance and propulsion technologies in combat environments.
Automotive industry groups have complained about the cumbersome process of trying to get necessary approvals, warning of increasing production threats as inventories deplete. China nevertheless appeared to offer U.S. and European auto giants something of a reprieve over the weekend.
China's Ministry of Commerce on Saturday said it was willing to establish a so-called ""green channel"" for eligible export license applications to expedite the approval process to European Union firms. Beijing also granted rare earth licenses to suppliers of U.S. auto giants General Motors, Ford and Jeep-maker Stellantis, Reuters reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources.
Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank, said it was just a matter of time before the defense industry sounds the alarm over a rare earth shortage — noting that many of them have already done so behind closed doors.
""Defense companies are in the front line of impact, given we need thousands of pounds of rare earths in each submarine and fighter jet,"" Baskaran told CNBC by email.
The U.S., European Union and Australia must coordinate supply- and demand-side interventions to boost rare earths production, CSIS' Baskaran said, adding that this need arises primarily because of prevailing price dynamics.
""If the price of praseodymium-neodymium (PrNd) oxide—a critical input for rare earth permanent magnets—remains below $60 per kilogram by 2030, nearly half of the projected non-Chinese supply would become financially unviable. On the supply side, this will necessitate measures such as production tax credits and subsidies,"" Baskaran said.
""On the demand side, implementing incentives to procure minerals from allied nations—similar to the provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act—will be essential,"" she added.
Magnet production
Last month, China temporarily paused export restrictions targeting 28 American companies following a trade truce reached between Washington and Beijing in Switzerland.
China continued to block exports from that country of seven rare earth metals to the U.S., however. Many of the 28 American companies given a reprieve on dual-use export restrictions are common targets of Beijing's sanctions because of their activity in the defense sector.
Henry Sanderson, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a London-based defense and security think tank, said the defense industry hasn't been nearly as vocal as the automotive sector when it comes to concerns over the impact of a rare earth shortage.
""Defense is hard because its less transparent, but they definitely use rare earths and rare earth magnets and especially what's called samarium cobalt magnets, but it's a much smaller demand than EVs or robots or anything like that,"" Sanderson told CNBC by phone.
""I'm less clear whether defense is as worried as the civilian industries, but saying that, looking at the level of magnet production in the West, it is very small,"" he added.

CNBC,Aerospace giant Rolls-Royce to build Britain’s first small modular nuclear reactors,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/rolls-royce-to-build-britains-first-small-modular-nuclear-reactors.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 09:11:56 GMT","British aerospace group Rolls-Royce on Tuesday received backing from the U.K. government to build the country's first small modular nuclear reactors.
The announcement follows a two-year selection process and reaffirms Britain's embrace of nuclear power, particularly as it also pledged on Tuesday to invest £14.2 billion ($19.2 billion) to build the large Sizewell C power station in eastern England.
U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said plans to build the country's first-ever small modular reactors (SMRs) would create thousands of jobs, support regional economies and strengthen energy security.
""We are ending the no-nuclear status quo as part of our Plan for Change and are entering a golden age of nuclear with the biggest building programme in a generation,"" Miliband said.
Britain's center-left Labour government said the plans could support up to 3,000 jobs and power the equivalent of 3 million homes once the SMRs are connected to the grid in the mid-2030s.
Rolls Royce welcomed the decision from Britain's state-owned energy company, Great British Energy - Nuclear, to build three SMR units. The FTSE 100 group said it represents a ""very significant milestone"" for the business and Rolls-Royce SMR.
""It is a vote of confidence in our unique nuclear capabilities, which will be recognised by governments around the world,"" Rolls-Royce CEO Tufan Erginbilgic said in a statement.
""It is also evidence that the strategic choices we have made in the transformation of Rolls-Royce are delivering,"" he added.
Shares of Rolls Royce rose more than 2% on the news, notching a fresh 52-week high.
The U.K. government said it intends to sign a contract with Rolls-Royce SMR and allocate a site later this year, subject to regulatory approval.
Divisive energy source
SMRs promise to have smaller and lighter footprints than traditional plants, potentially making them cheaper and quicker to build when they are fully commercialized.
Amazon and Google both signed deals last year to develop SMRs in the U.S. as tech giants increasingly turn to nuclear to fulfill the growing energy demands from data centers.
As it is low-carbon, advocates argue that nuclear power has the potential to play a significant role in helping countries generate electricity while slashing emissions and reducing their reliance on fossil fuels.
Some environmental groups, however, warn the nuclear industry is an expensive and harmful distraction to cheaper and cleaner alternatives.","Aerospace giant Rolls-Royce to build Britain’s first small modular nuclear reactors British aerospace group Rolls-Royce on Tuesday received backing from the U.K. government to build the country's first small modular nuclear reactors.

Shares of Rolls Royce rose more than 2% on the news, notching a fresh 52-week high. The U.K. government said it intends to sign a contract with Rolls-Royce SMR and allocate a site later this year, subject to regulatory approval. Divisive energy source SMRs promise to have smaller and lighter footprints than traditional plants, potentially making them cheaper and quicker to build when they are fully commercialized. Amazon and Google both signed deals last year to develop SMRs in the U.S. as tech giants increasingly turn to nuclear to fulfill the growing energy demands from data centers. As it is low-carbon, advocates argue that nuclear power has the potential to play a significant role in helping countries generate electricity while slashing emissions and reducing their reliance on fossil fuels. Some environmental groups, however, warn the nuclear industry is an expensive and harmful distraction to cheaper and cleaner alternatives.",Positive,0.6101
CNBC,"Couples who follow one simple rule tend to fight less and be happier in the long run, says relationship expert",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/couples-who-use-a-relationship-bank-account-tend-to-fight-less-be-happier-says-relationship-expert.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 14:44:01 GMT","Couples often feel like they have the same arguments over and over again.
As a therapist, I've heard many couples describe how a seemingly minor disagreement can spiral into an intense fight that goes unresolved, and eventually repeats without changing or improving. Even when they're not fighting, these couples report an underlying tension between them that makes it difficult to enjoy their relationship.
To break this pattern, I encourage them to start a ""relationship bank account,"" in which they make ""deposits"" when they're not in conflict. These deposits are actions that make the other person feel like their happiness is being prioritized.
The current account balance reflects how safe and secure couples feel in their relationship. A positive balance means they know they have the emotional ""funds"" to handle any surprise ""bills"" with a minimum of conflict; a negative balance means any unexpected ""charge"" can send them into a ""debt"" spiral that causes a blowout fight.
Ultimately, the goal is to make more deposits than withdrawals, with arguments becoming less intense and, eventually, less frequent.
I start this process by asking each partner what makes them feel loved and appreciated. Then we can determine what kinds of actions they can each take to make deposits into their relationship bank account.
Here are four common ways to bolster your account:
1. Checking in
It's easy for a relationship to fall into a familiar pattern of work, chores, kids, and screens. You might spend hours a day in close physical proximity to your partner, but you may not feel connected to them. If that's the case, check in and find a few minutes of connection.
This can be as simple as turning to your partner and giving them your undivided attention for a few minutes. How was their day? How is that issue they were dealing with at work going? Are they feeling okay physically? Is there anything you can do to help?
2. Random acts
A random hug as you pass your partner in the kitchen. A kissy face emoji sent from work. An inexpensive but thoughtful gift. An unexpected compliment. Random acts are small things that require little effort, yet their effect on your partner can be outsized.
These small deposits let your partner know you're thinking about them at times when they least expect it.
3. Active planning
There's often one partner who always makes plans, and it's easy for them to start feeling underappreciated. Making an effort to switch up the roles can have a positive effect.
Take on planning with something as simple as making dinner reservations at a favorite restaurant or as complicated as mapping out a weekend getaway. Even if the results aren't perfect, it shows that you're listening to your partner and addressing their needs.
4. Intimacy (and sex!)
Most people assume that intimacy means sex, but sex is simply a form of intimacy. Intimacy means having an emotional connection and a feeling of closeness.
The actions we've explored so far can make your partner feel seen and supported, which can lead to an emotional connection, which can lead to emotionally meaningful sex — all of which can add to the balance in your relationship bank account.
Make sure you have an 'emergency fund'
The deposits above are often missing in unhappy relationships. In my experience, couples tend to overlook these small actions more and more over time. The longer you've been in a relationship, the more likely you are to encounter a low balance — or an overdraft — in your relationship bank account.
The key is to break through any resistance you might feel, and remember how impactful the little things can be when they add up. By making small, regular deposits into your relationship bank account, you're building up savings when times are good — and giving yourselves a cushion to withdraw from when they're not.

Businesses are hiring at one of the slowest paces in the last 10 years, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and as many as 7.2 million people are unemployed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
If you're currently looking for work, experts recommend tapping into your network as much as possible and celebrating the small wins — even if they're as small as updating your resume. And, in fact, the job search process can be a good way to update your resume, which might in turn help you land a job.
Here's how.
Even 'almost identical' roles have 'nuance'
One thing the job search lets you do is ensure you're using the most relevant language.
""Even if you're applying for almost identical types of roles, there's nuance there,"" says Octavia Goredema, career coach and author of ""PREP, PUSH, PIVOT."" When you're reading the descriptions of the jobs you apply to, you'll notice ""there might be different measures for success and there might be different words that are used to describe some core functions,"" she says.
For the jobs you're interested in, update your resume to include their language, to the extent that it reflects your experience. ""What you're trying to do is align who you are, what you do best, and the experience you have with what your next employer is looking for,"" she says.
With the labor market in a state of flux as companies implement AI usage, matching what you see on job descriptions can also help ensure you're using the most ""up-to-date language,"" says Julie Bauke, founder of career coach company The Bauke Group.
'Something you did two years ago' could be relevant
Your job search can also help to remind you of what you haven't included in your resume.
""You might think that something you did two years ago is completely irrelevant,"" says Bauke. ""But it may be really of value today."" Reading those job descriptions can give you a sense of what employers are looking for, including skills and accomplishments you've forgotten about yourself.
If you come across something a company wants to see in their candidates in the ""responsibilities"" or ""qualifications"" sections, for example, that you've done and that you have yet to highlight, add it to your resume. Give examples of how you've accomplished that particular task in a bullet under the job title or in your summary with numerical evidence of success (""exceeded sales goal by 30%,"" for example).
""Even if you don't get an offer from a role that you really wanted,"" says Goredema, go back and look at what that employer was looking for and see if there's anything ""that you would add to your resume that you think would make you stand out even more in the future?""

CNBC,69-year-old CEO says he turned 19 employees into millionaires after selling the company in a $1 billion deal,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/daves-hot-chicken-ceo-turned-19-employees-into-millionaires.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:00:01 GMT","Like countless others, Bill Phelps wanted to get rich when he was younger. Now, the 69-year-old CEO of Dave's Hot Chicken and former CEO and co-founder of Wetzel's Pretzels says he gets fulfillment out of helping others find financial success.
In the last two weeks, 19 Dave's employees became millionaires after private equity firm Roark Capital acquired a majority stake of the Pasadena, California-based chicken finger chain in deal worth ""close to"" $1 billion, Phelps said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on June 2.
Creating that many millionaires was intentional, Phelps tells CNBC Make It.
""I had some investors who were like, 'you're giving away too much money, this isn't right,'"" he says. ""They were absolutely right as investors to stand up for other investors. They have a fiduciary duty, but I have a duty to the people that created this business and I was true to taking care of all of those stakeholders in this deal.""
As part of the deal, every Dave's corporate employee, store manager and assistant manager received a bonus roughly equivalent to their yearly salary, president and COO of Dave's Jim Bitticks told Nation's Restaurant News.
Dave's Hot Chicken got its start in 2017 when three childhood friends pooled $900 in savings to open a chicken finger stand in a Los Angeles parking lot.
Phelps, a franchise business veteran who founded Wetzel's Pretzels in 1994 and sat on Blaze Pizza's board of directors until 2020, became CEO of Dave's in 2019 after an investor group Phelps was a member of acquired a stake in the company with plans to franchise the brand, the company told NRN in 2019.
Giving credit where credit's due
In 2024, Dave's co-founder Arman Oganesyan told the ""How I Built This with Guy Raz"" podcast that the friends were courted by many investors looking for a stake in the company in the early days of the business, but Phelps and his co-investors stood out because they were willing to give Oganesyan and his fellow founders credit for their work.
""A lot of people came in with this energy of, 'you guys got really lucky and you don't know what you're going to do with this,'"" Oganesyan said. Phelps and his co-investors seemed to understand that it wasn't all luck, he said.
Nearly six years later, giving credit where credit's due continues to be a driving factor in Phelps' leadership style, Phelps says. As leader of Dave's corporate operations, he doesn't micromanage because he trusts his employees to do their jobs well, he says.
For the same reason, he also pays them ""generously.""
""I was told by one of my investors that I had no concept of what management compensation should look like,"" Phelps says with a chuckle. ""And he's right, because I don't look at them as management. I look at them as my partners in this journey, and I compensate them as partners in the journey.""
Making millionaires
Phelps isn't the first CEO to turn his employees into millionaires through the acquisition of a company.
Billionaire investor Mark Cuban makes it a habit to give employees bonuses with every company he sells, he said on social media platform X last year. When he sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in stock in 1999, 300 of the company's 330 employees became millionaires, he said.
When Jay Chaudhry, billionaire founder and CEO of cloud cybersecurity firm Zscaler, sold his first company, SecureIT, to VeriSign in an all-stock deal in 1998, at least 70 of his employees became millionaires after VeriSign's stock price surged two years later, he told CNBC Make It last year.
""People were going crazy in the company, because they had never thought of so much money,"" he said. ""A lot of them were buying new houses. They were buying new cars. They could do what they wanted to do.""

CNBC,U.S. travelers are cutting back on summer Europe trips — but Chinese tourists are making up for it,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/us-travellers-are-cutting-back-on-summer-europe-trips.html,"Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:01:50 GMT","U.S. tourists seem to be cutting back on summer trips to Europe — but Chinese travelers are more than making up for it, a study found.
Data from the European Travel Commission (ETC) published Tuesday showed that just 33% of U.S. survey respondents were planning to visit Europe this summer, some 7% below the levels of last year.
The decline appears to largely relate to funding, with 54% of those polled citing high travel costs as a barrier.
But political concerns, including those around the perception of the U.S. abroad, also appear to be weighing on plans, the ETC said.
""Travel sentiment is strongest among Americans from the Northeast (43% vs. 33% in the total sample), a region that typically leans Democratic and diverges politically from Trump,"" the organization noted.
Popular European tourist destinations usually welcome millions of visitors from the U.S. each year. U.S. tourists in the U.K. in 2023 for example totaled a record 5.1 million, while U.S. visitors were among the top five countries bringing the most cash into the French economy last year.
The decline in interest in a European summer isn't limited to U.S. travelers. Around 39% of total respondents to the ETC's survey said they were planning such a holiday in 2025, compared to 41% in 2024. Sentiment around European travel has also pulled back among travelers from Brazil, Canada and Japan.
But interest in European summer trips shot up among Chinese travelers, with 72% of survey respondents from the country saying they were planning such a holiday — up 10% from the previous year.
""The strong sentiment is supported by growing disposable incomes, favourable travel policies, and a consumer shift toward prioritising personal fulfilment and lifestyle experiences such as tourism,"" the ETC said.
The National Bureau of Statistics of China earlier this year said that the nationwide per capita disposable income grew by more than 5% over the previous year in the first quarter of 2025. Domestically, concerns have nevertheless mounted over the resilience of the Chinese consumer: weak consumer demand drove prices lower recently, while retail sales growth slowed in April.
Europe has long been a key destination for Chinese tourists, with many looking to buy luxury goods whilst away. This trend came to a screeching halt during the Covid-19 pandemic, but could be picking back up now.
Over half of Chinese travelers now say that shopping is part of their European travel plans, according to the ETC data. Yet, the figures also suggest that travelers might be shifting their spending patterns, with Chinese tourists now especially likelier to tighten the belt. Just 29% of them are expecting to spend more than 200 euros ($229) a day, a 44% drop compared to last year. Instead, the majority of Chinese visitors is now looking to spend between 100 and 200 euros per day.","U.S. travelers are cutting back on summer Europe trips — but Chinese tourists are making up for it U.S. tourists seem to be cutting back on summer trips to Europe — but Chinese travelers are more than making up for it, a study found.

Forbes,The Capital of Quantum | Paid Program,https://www.forbes.com/sites/state-of-maryland/2025/05/09/the-capital-of-quantum-how-maryland-plans-to-power-tomorrows-tech/,,"There, an emerging ecosystem of talent and innovation is working to turn the technology’s extraordinary potential into real-world impact, backed by $1 billion in combined investment over the next five years.
Along with life sciences and aerospace, quantum is one of three “lighthouse” industries targeted by Maryland Governor Wes Moore’s administration for amplified spending and growth. Applying the principles of quantum science–which studies fundamentals of how matter and energy behave—quantum innovation can help tackle problems exponentially more complex than is possible with today’s technology, and pave the way for breakthroughs in communication, computing, machine learning, imaging and beyond.
“We will not back off of traditional, strong industry sectors from tourism to agriculture to manufacturing, but we want to diversify and grow our economy and that’s a reason why we’re in quantum,” says Harry Coker Jr., Maryland’s Secretary of Commerce. Prior to this role, Coker advised the nation’s leaders on cybersecurity strategy and policy as U.S. National Cyber Director. He’s also held senior leadership positions at the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency, where he was executive director until 2019.
Maryland’s investment builds on the state’s uniquely strong roots in quantum innovation, with academic institutions like the University of Maryland (UMD), defense organizations like the National Security Agency, global partnerships like the National Institute of Standards and Technology and commercial enterprises like the multi-billion dollar quantum software developer IonQ—all advancing the potential of quantum technology in the state.
Below, explore Maryland’s ecosystem of quantum innovation, and learn how it’s become a strategic launchpad for the technology’s growth.
In January, Gov. Moore announced the Capital of Quantum initiative as part of his state budget proposal for 2026. The approved budget commits $42.5 million to launch the effort—an investment expected to unlock up to $200 million in additional support from federal partners, commercial investors and philanthropic organizations. This is part of a larger, five-year plan to generate $1 billion in total quantum funding through public-private collaboration.
“Quantum is not just the future of one industry sector like IT, but the future of every industry. The next generation of advanced computing power can change how data is analyzed, how products are developed, how businesses identify opportunities and risks, and how they plan for the future,” said Gov. Moore. “This has the potential to transform every part of our economy and society, from national security to health care. Maryland already has extraordinary assets and partnerships to support quantum development, and we have a clear strategy to build on those assets and make our state the quantum capital of the world.”
UMD will get a sizable upgrade in quantum technology presence and investment. Over $185 million is committed to erect a new building at the university, which will include hands-on research opportunities in on-site quantum labs. The state has also committed $10 million to help develop a new 100,000 square-foot headquarters for IonQ, the commercial quantum computer operation originally founded on the UMD campus.
Founded in 2015, but building on decades of quantum computing dedication, Maryland-born IonQ uses lasers to trap and manipulate ions, constructing computer chassis around them about the size of commercial refrigerators. Unlike GPU farms, which need extreme amounts of power and cooling to operate, IonQ’s quantum computers plug into regular wall power. The company’s rapid, innovative pace has yielded over 900 patents and counting.
“Quantum is no longer a technology that’s just around the corner,” says Niccolo de Masi, President and CEO of IonQ. Instead, he believes that decades of hard work is now beginning to have a mainstream payoff.
IonQ was the first quantum computing specialist to be listed on a major exchange and today carries a multi-billion dollar capitalization. It counts among its clients multiple defense agency labs along with giants in aerospace, pharmaceuticals, fraud detection and renewable energy. Solving problems like the most efficient way to use an aircraft cargo hold, or helping devise the next generation of long-term storage batteries, is only part of the IonQ mission.
“Human ingenuity, classical artificial intelligence and quantum AI will find solutions to problems that we never even thought we needed to solve,” de Masi says.
The Capital of Quantum campaign will take five years to fund. It will take even longer to realize its full, long-term impact. But Coker is confident that the money heading to key universities will show its worth quickly. As Maryland students better prepare for a quantum computing era, Maryland companies will be better able to hire and retain local citizens, who will in turn help define what the future of quantum looks like.
“A very key short-term return is talent development, because a number of our top-flight colleges and universities in the state have quantum majors and other quantum studies,” he says.
UMD in particular has earned a reputation for excellence in quantum research. Over the past decade alone, over 100 physics PhDs with quantum science specialties have graduated. The university is one of just five schools engaged in a National Science Foundation program which uses quantum computers to further simulate and model the quantum mechanics they rely upon.
But across the state, other institutions including Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County have also developed robust quantum physics programs. Statewide, hundreds of faculty members teach quantum.
This momentum has made Maryland a destination for the world’s top talent and leading research to converge.
To promulgate an ecosystem of quantum innovation, Maryland’s leaders recognize that collaboration between its institutions of research, development and commerce is key. Together, these organizations are among those bolstering the state’s collective push for quantum advancement:
- Quantum Startup Foundry (QSF): Located at UMD, the QSF is a space dedicated to supporting entrepreneurs, startups and enterprises with physical and virtual resources to accelerate the time to market of quantum technologies. It provides assistance including: Both in-person and remote networking, guidance for early-stage startups navigating challenges around research, fundraising and basic office operations and assistance connecting with potential major quantum clients.
- Mid-Atlantic Quantum Alliance (MQA): A global forum of academics, industry leaders, government officials, researchers and experts in the quantum field. Founded in 2020 and facilitated by UMD, it emphasizes networking and connection in a mission to engage key support and foster collaboration for quantum innovation.
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): A federal standards-setting body in which quantum computing experts are particularly interested in how the rise of quantum and its extremely high-speed solutions will affect previously robust cryptography. NIST will be tasked with defining new encryption methods to provide security in a quantum computing world.
“Maryland has the academic institutions to press this forward, Maryland also has key federal installations, and those are all key to computing and cybersecurity and helping us advance quantum computing,” Coker says. “From our cell phones, to our laptops, to our video, they're all going to need a post-quantum cryptography capability as well.”
The state of Maryland is taking a bold step to ensure that the future of quantum technology is imagined, researched and brought to life in its universities, laboratories and federal installations. With one of just two quantum-specific business accelerators in the U.S. and the first publicly traded quantum pioneer, IonQ, Maryland’s focused five-year investment will unlock new opportunities for the next generation of entrepreneur and physicist.
“Every element of the legislative and executive branch in Maryland understands how unique Maryland has been in supporting quantum now for 30 years,” de Masi says. “And we expect that our interest in an ecosystem here is only going to increase in its depth and breadth, along with our investment.”
The future looks bright in the Mid-Atlantic for highly innovative, low-power technology that solves problems previous generations couldn’t even guess at.

Forbes,Presented by EY - Beyond The Blueprint: How These Four CEOs Built Billion-Dollar Businesses | Paid Program,https://www.forbes.com/sites/luisakroll/2025/03/17/beyond-the-blueprint-how-these-four-ceos-built-billion-dollar-businesses/,,"Building a business from nothing to $1 billion-plus requires more than just a good idea and hard work. Forbes spoke with four billionaire CEOs who started from scratch, learned from their prior mistakes, overcame long odds and created notable companies that are thriving. Each of them operates in a different industry—telecom, fintech, construction and IT services—and each founder brings their own perspective to running and scaling an enterprise. All share the same goal: building a resilient business that delivers on its promises and keeps customers coming back for more.
One leadership principle that John Fish has embraced in building Boston-based Suffolk into a $7 billion (2024 revenue) business is that people have to be willing to make mistakes.
“It’s humility. That’s the biggest thing,” says Fish, age 65.
That’s why years ago he created a “No Fault Culture” at his company. Employees are encouraged to take risks and do things differently, without worrying about short-term costs. “If we don’t innovate we’ll die,” says Fish. That’s why Suffolk has gambled heavily on robots on construction sites and embraced generative AI to help with everything from scheduling to architectural and engineering designs.
Fish first adopted this flexible mindset around 2008 during the Great Recession. In just four hours one September day shortly after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the then-$2 billion (revenue) Suffolk lost $1 billion in backlog as customers suddenly canceled plans to build. Fish didn’t know how he’d make payroll, but he knew that his company would not survive unless it did things differently. Rather than look to other companies in the construction category, he started studying firms outside his industry, including Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. It was around that time that he decided that Suffolk would start leveraging data to hone in on its competitive edge. Fish began to invest heavily in data and technology.
In 2017, he hired MIT grad and McKinsey & Company data scientist Jit Kee Chin as Chief Data Officer. He also brought on 39 analysts to pour through historical data from hundreds of projects and created a mission control center at its headquarters where the findings are studied to help teams make better business decisions. Think Moneyball for construction: data captured from jobsites is monitored on everything from safety to cost to project delays; generative AI then evaluates the findings to spot red flags, by predicting which sites might have safety risks or are more likely to go over budget.
“You can’t manage what you can’t measure,” says Fish.
Part of Suffolk’s strategy has always been to diversify across regions and sectors to soften the blow in case any one part of the business falters. This flexible approach has also helped the company pivot into new projects. Seven years ago, mixed-use commercial/residential represented 80% of Suffolk’s revenue. Then Covid and the work from home trend hit office construction hard, pushing Suffolk to reevaluate. Now it’s just 20% of revenue, with 36% from data centers and more than one-fourth from aviation and universities, including Dartmouth, Boston College and Northeastern.
In an industry that has been changing so much—for the first time in history, construction costs are higher than the value of some finished buildings, Fish says—he is even more open to new ideas. Every quarter, he invites a company from overseas to come to Boston to exchange ideas and learn from each other. Among recent visitors: Goldbeck GmbH, one of Germany’s biggest construction companies, known for its focus on efficiency and prefabricated building systems; and Kazakhstan’s BI Group Construction Holding, which claims to be the top development company in the Central Asian region.
Suffolk also sends teams overseas: a group recently spent time in Japan at Takenaka Corp., a more than 400-year-old firm. Some executives also traveled last year to a leadership retreat in Normandy, France, where they attended lectures from Harvard Business School professors and military personnel, and studied leadership case studies from the D-Day invasion.
Fish is convinced all of this will help his company survive this time of change.
“There is a reckoning right now in the industry,” says Fish. “We’re trying to lead the conversation both from an AI and need-to-digitalize standpoint. If you don’t go in this direction, you’ll perish in six to 12 months.”
Ankur Jain founded fintech firm Bilt Rewards in 2019, aiming to replicate the success that airlines like Delta have had with their rewards program—but targeted at apartment and home renters. Key to the company’s progress to date: inking deals with a range of crucial partners, from some of the country’s largest apartment building owners to credit card issuer Mastercard to merchants like Alaska Airlines and Lyft.
The beauty of this model is efficient customer acquisition.
“I learned the hard way on my first business that [the] model doesn't work at scale when you're just spending to acquire customers,” says Jain, referring to Humin, a contact management app that he cofounded in 2012.
(Dating app Tinder bought its technology four years later for an undisclosed sum.) These days he doesn’t have to spend much to acquire customers. His company gets paid by his real estate partners to handle tenants’ monthly rent payments. In return, renters who choose to join Bilt earn reward points to use at other merchants.
For Bilt, getting the first apartment owner to sign on as a partner was hard.
“It was two years of pitching,” recalls Jain, age 35. In the middle of the Covid pandemic, when apartment vacancies had risen in places like New York City, property owners became willing to take the risk of working with an unproven startup. In 2021, AvalonBay Communities (owner of 90,000 apartments in 12 states); Related Companies (owner of 73,000 apartments) and Equity Residential (owner of or investor in 84,000 apartments) agreed to bring on Bilt to handle its tenants’ payments.
Bilt later signed deals with outfits like fitness chain SoulCycle and other gyms, rideshare firm Lyft and more than 20,000 restaurants, enabling Bilt Rewards members to earn points each time they take a class, hail a Lyft or have a meal. Every time they do, Bilt gets a sliver of the revenue those members generate. Then Jain’s company passes a sliver of that back to the property owners (he won’t say how much).
Jain describes Bilt’s model as having a flywheel effect. “As we started getting the first buildings [signed] on and they had success, it then helped us attract more merchants, which then generated more revenue to share back with buildings who were part of the ecosystem, which then helped us sign more [apartment] buildings,” says Jain.
The company has 3.5 million customers and had revenue last year of $275 million, up from $116 million in 2022. Private investors have put more than $550 million into Bilt, valuing the company at $3.25 billion.
Robert Hale trained for and ran the Boston Marathon with 30 teammates last year. In August, he and 35 others will ride bikes 186 miles over two days from Sturbridge in western Massachusetts to Provincetown on Cape Cod as part of the Pan-Mass Challenge, an annual fundraising event for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Most workdays, he also joins regulars at a CrossFit training class at 6:30 a.m. and again at noon. An exercise junkie? Maybe. But there is another reason for his fitness regimen: teambuilding.
The CEO of $1.8 billion (2024 revenue) Quincy, Massachusetts-based telecom firm Granite Communications describes these and other company activities, from 14 intramural sports teams and charity events to book clubs and game nights, as the “bedrock” of Granite.
“It matters to everyone to be a part of a community they care for,” says Hale, 58, who insists that keeping his 2,000 employees happy is key to the company’s success.
Before Granite, he started another telecom firm, Network Plus. Wooed by Wall Street, Hale took on debt and then took it public in 1999. But it struggled amid the dot-com bust and declared bankruptcy in 2002, laying off hundreds of workers. It had a big impact on him.
“I was focused on 90-day thresholds,” he says, not his team—and not on the long term. He hasn’t made that mistake again, choosing to keep Granite private so he could run it as he sees fit.
Beyond the perks are real benefits: Granite commits to almost exclusively promoting employees from within and gives managers a pool of money to dole out as promotions and raises. Granite employees, in turn, are the ones who keep its 17,000 customers, including 75% of America’s biggest companies (Nike and CVS, for instance), happy.
“There is a vigorous emphasis on making customers happy through thick and thin, and that in turn makes [staffers] happy,” says Hale. “Happy customers, happy teammates, full circle.”
Maybe it’s because Raj Sardana arrived in the U.S. from India with just $100 in his pocket. Or maybe it’s because the Georgia Tech graduate got laid off from his early job as an electrical engineer at a Pratt & Whitney supplier. Whatever the reason, Sardana is always obsessing over what his IT services provider, Innova Solutions, can do next for its customers.
“We’re paranoid. That’s why we work so hard,” says the self-made billionaire, who claims to still work 18 hours a day, seven days a week making sure Innova delivers more to its customers than it promises. “We’re client focused. We understand their pain points and solve them with technology,” adds Sardana, age 65.
Back when Innova’s predecessor, American CyberSystems, was getting started in the late 1990s, Sardana brought Indian programmers over on H1-B visas to help U.S. firms prepare for the Y2K “millennium bug.” That crisis ended quickly but then came the September 11th terrorist attacks. Leveraging his aerospace background, he began supplying much-needed engineering talent to defense contractors like Northrop Grumman.
Nowadays there’s a lot more competition in the world of outsourcing, and Innova gambled on acquisitions to keep pace, picking up attractive clients like Tesla and Harley Davidson. It bought six companies in 2021 and 2022, tripling its revenue to $2.4 billion. Innova hopes to win more business from existing customers.
“Marketing is not my strength. Instead I make sure we deliver excellence,” says Sardana. “If we acquire a client from [an] acquisition, we wow them with delivery.”
One Sardana says they wowed is a large North American bank, which Innova added to its client list as part of a 2021 acquisition; since then, the bank has increased its spending with Innova by 37% to $80 million annually.
Last year Innova’s revenue dipped to $2.3 billion as it jettisoned money-losing clients and focused on profitability, more than doubling its net profit margin to 6%, but it’s hoping for more wins ahead.
Innova is working quickly to incorporate generative AI to improve cost optimization. In one case, it is using AI on behalf of a telecom client to automate test cases, or essentially checklists that help make sure software is functioning properly; that in turn helped cut its quality engineering costs by 30% and reduced the number of Innova staffers needed for that client to 219 from 300. Says Sardana, “We always have to be on the cutting edge. We’re always looking ahead of the curve.”","Presented by EY - Beyond The Blueprint: How These Four CEOs Built Billion-Dollar Businesses | Paid Program Building a business from nothing to $1 billion-plus requires more than just a good idea and hard work.

Forbes,The U.S. Government Is Stuck With SpaceX. But Trump Can Still Hurt It.,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2025/06/06/trump-musk-spacex/,,"In the barrage of attacks that President Donald Trump and Elon Musk fired at each other Thursday, one stood out: Trump’s threat to cancel federal contracts with companies owned by the world’s richest man.
The primary target: SpaceX, which has received at least $21 billion in government contracts, with about $13 billion still outstanding.
Musk probably doesn’t have much to fear. Legally, the Trump administration would likely enmire itself in lengthy legal disputes if it appeared to cancel contracts out of spite. Moreover, as the world’s No. 1 launch provider and maker of low-Earth orbit satellites, SpaceX may have made itself indispensable.
“The [U.S. government] is simply too locked in to cut them off over a social media meltdown,” said Kimberly Siversen Burke, director of government affairs at the consultancy Quilty Space.
Nonetheless, there are some types of contracts that could be vulnerable for cancellation, and ways the government could lessen its dependence on SpaceX going forward.
IN A CLASS BY ITSELF
The 134 rockets SpaceX launched last year accounted for 83% of all satellites put into orbit worldwide. With its reliable, partially reusable Falcon 9, the company has come to dominate U.S. national security launches. Its chief competitor, United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, has struggled to keep up, with multiyear delays in developing its new Vulcan rocket.
The U.S. government may have more options to carry its military satellites to space going forward. Vulcan is now operational and Blue Origin, the space company founded by Musk’s billionaire rival Jeff Bezos, pulled off a successful first launch of its New Glenn rocket in January. In the latest round of contracts awarded by Space Force, SpaceX won 28 launches from 2027 through 2032, a little more than half, with ULA getting 19 and Blue Origin seven.
But ULA and Blue Origin have their hands full scaling up, said Todd Harrison, a defense and space analyst with the American Enterprise Institute. “There's no replacing SpaceX. You just do not have the capacity in our other launch options.”
SpaceX has also become a major supplier of national security satellites. The National Reconnaissance Office is depending on SpaceX to build out a multibillion-dollar network of hundreds of spy satellites in low-Earth orbit based on the company’s Starshield platform.
For delivering cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station, NASA has also had to rely on SpaceX, as Boeing has struggled to fix defects in its Starliner spacecraft.
But there are some relatively small-dollar SpaceX contracts that could be vulnerable, said Burke. The government could lower its exposure to SpaceX by looking for early phase development programs that don’t have a contractor locked in yet.
For example, SpaceX has won roughly $140 million in contracts on an Air Force program to test whether commercial satellite services can be integrated into tactical military communications, Burke said.
Another way Trump could hurt Musk, as well as Ukraine, would be to cancel or reduce a $537 million contract to provide Starlink satellite communications services to the Ukrainian military.
But rather than targeting existing contracts, where the administration could make a greater impact is by steering new business to others and reorienting its plans. The Commerce Department could backtrack on a revamp announced in March to a $42 billion program to expand rural broadband access that was expected to make Starlink eligible to compete for grants. Till now the program has only included telecom companies laying fiber-optic cables.
Trump could also pull back from the support he promised in his inaugural address for Musk’s ultimate ambition: to reach Mars. “Where Trump can single handedly harm SpaceX in a significant way is redirecting the mission goals for NASA,” Harrison said.
Given how mercurial Musk has proven to be, perhaps diversifying away from SpaceX isn’t a bad idea. Burke worries, however, that the bad blood will undo years of work to convince the Pentagon and other national security agencies that they can rely on any commercial companies. “Elon’s antics are threatening to rewind the tape,” she said.

Forbes,Baldoni Vs. Lively Feud: 14 Women’s Advocacy Groups Back Lively In New Amicus Brief,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2025/06/05/baldoni-vs-lively-feud-14-womens-advocacy-groups-back-lively-in-new-amicus-brief/,,"Topline
Blake Lively made a rare address of her legal battle on her Instagram on Monday night, thanking supporters and the women’s rights groups that backed her with amicus curiae briefs after a federal judge dismissed her “It Ends With Us” director and co-star Justin Baldoni’s suit accusing her of defamation and extortion. (Here are in-depth explanations for Lively’s claims and Baldoni’s claims.)
Timeline
Lively said she and the 19 women’s groups that backed her in court “stood proudly” in “defending women’s rights to speak up for their safety,” stating she felt the “pain of a retaliatory lawsuit” and the “manufactured shame that tries to break us,” hours after a judge dismissed Baldoni’s defamation and extortion lawsuit filed against her.
Judge Lewis Liman dismissed Baldoni’s $400 million lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds and his $250 million lawsuit against The New York Times, after Baldoni alleged they each conspired in a “vitriolic smear campaign” to end his career—Lively’s attorneys Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb celebrated Liman’s ruling as a “total victory and a complete vindication.”
Liman ruled Baldoni did not allege Lively was responsible for comments made outside of her civil suit against him, which are “privileged,” while Reynolds, Lively’s publicist Leslie Sloan and the Times published or made other statements about Baldoni they believed were true “based on the information available to them.”
In a new amicus curiae brief, 14 women’s rights groups, including the National Organization for Women and its New York City chapter, the National Network to End Domestic Violence and the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, supported Lively’s claims of sexual harassment against Baldoni while accusing him of using the “DARVO” tactic—deny, attack, reverse victim and offender—to smear and silence Lively.
Lively’s legal team has portrayed Baldoni—who has advocated for women throughout has career, including in a viral Ted Talk in 2017—as turning his back on his feminist beliefs: “Baldoni is now contradicting years of his own public persona,” Lively’s legal team told Forbes in a statement, citing Baldoni’s legal team’s attempt to challenge the amicus briefs.
Baldoni’s lawyers said in a legal filing Lively’s counsel informed them she has requested to withdraw her claim of emotional distress made in her lawsuit against Baldoni, which his lawyers say was done after his legal team requested she provide medical and mental health records to demonstrate the distress she says she suffered.
Baldoni’s lawyers also said in their letter to the judge they oppose Lively’s request to withdraw her emotional distress claim without prejudice, which means she can refile the claim at a later time, though Lively’s lawyers dismissed Baldoni’s legal team’s letter as a “a press stunt” and that they are “streamlining and focusing” Lively’s case.
Lively’s legal team accused Baldoni and his lawyers of trying to “prevent women’s rights groups from being heard” in a statement to Forbes, alleging they are trying to “shred a law designed to protect all victims just to make sure they ‘bury’ one,” referring to the #MeToo law Lively invoked.

Taylor Swift was subpoenaed in Baldoni’s lawsuit against Lively, which includes texts from Lively that appear to refer to Swift as “one of her dragons,” though representatives for the billionaire singer argued she should not be involved in the dispute, tellingoutlets she plans to take the stand and testify once her trial begins: “The ultimate moment for a plaintiff's story to be told is at trial. We expect that to be the case here. So we would, of course, expect her to be a witness at her trial.

Lively’s legal team told multiple newstelevised interview since filing her lawsuit against Baldoni to promote “Another Simple Favor” on Seth Meyers’ late night show, in which she acknowledged she can’t discuss much about her legal battle with Baldoni—whom she did not address by name—but stated she has faced the “highest highs and the lowest lows of my life” over the past “intense year,” adding she feels “fortunate” she has been able to speak about her experience because many women are “afraid to share their experiences” or do not have the opportunity to.

allegation that a character in the 2024 Marvel film “Deadpool & Wolverine,” Nicepool, was crafted by Ryan Reynolds as a caricature of Baldoni, Marvel Studios sent a letter to Liman asking the court to squash Baldoni’s subpoena for relevant documents, stating the claims are irrelevant to Baldoni’s claims of defamation and that releasing confidential Marvel documents would harm the studio.
In response to Baldoni’samended response to Jones’ lawsuit against Baldoni, which she filed in December accusing him of defamation and breach of contract, Baldoni accused Jones of colluding with Lively to file a “sham legal proceeding” in New York court in September under a company affiliated with Lively, Vanzan Inc., against unnamed defendants as a “transparent ploy to obtain subpoena power” without Lively’s name attached so the parties could obtain text messages—which were central to Lively’s claims, and the basis for a New York Times story—sent among Baldoni’s team.
In anIn a statement to Deadline, Jones’s lawyer Kristen Tahler accused Baldoni’s team of “presenting zero new evidence” and of conducting “a desperate ploy by a team who tonight all but admits they’re in trouble.”
Lively attended the Time 100 Gala as an honoree, where she made a speech apparently alluding to her ongoing legal battle: “I have so much to say about the last two years of my life, but tonight is not the forum,"" Lively said, in a speech in which she largely focused on abuse against women, a central theme of “It Ends With Us,” and revealed her mother was a victim of abuse.

In her motion to dismiss, Lively slammed Baldoni’s “vengeful and rambling lawsuit” as a “profound abuse of the legal process,” urging the court to “dismiss all claims against Ms. Lively with prejudice, deny leave to amend, and award Ms. Lively all relief sought,” including attorney’s fees and damages for “reputational and emotional harm.”
Reynolds filed a motion to dismiss Baldoni’s lawsuit, in which he is named as a co-defendant, alleging Baldoni’s lawsuit does not prove Reynolds defamed him and is instead “a list of grievances attempting to shame Mr. Reynolds for being the man Mr. Baldoni has built his brand pretending to be.”

Lively attended the South by Southwesthearing Thursday, Lively’s attorneys argued certain information should be treated as highly classified “attorney’s eyes only” material, which lawyer Sigrid McCawley said would help minimize the risk of “irreparable harm if marginal conversations with high profile individuals with no relevance to the case were to fall into wrong hands”—apparently suggesting messages between Lively and celebrity friends may leak. The judge did not rule on the request Thursday.
At aThough it’s unclear which “high profile individuals” McCawley was referring to, Baldoni’s lawyer Bryan Freedman has previously suggested he could request Lively’s friend Taylor Swift testify, after she appeared to be referred to in Baldoni’s lawsuit.
Los Angeles Times published an investigative report on Baldoni’s career, citing multiple unnamed employees at his Wayfarer Studios production company, some of whom said he injected “toxic positivity” and his Bahai faith into the workplace culture in a way that felt “professionally inappropriate.”
TheRepresentatives for Baldoni and Wayfarer told the Los Angeles Times there have “never been any reported complaints regarding the workplace culture” and Wayfarer’s work is rooted in “various faiths and backgrounds.”

Lewis Liman, a U.S. district judge, said the New York Times’Shapiro, who formerly served as the CIA’s deputy chief of staff between 2013 and 2015 before starting his own strategic consulting firm, will advise Lively’s litigation team on legal communications relating to the lawsuit she filed against Baldoni in New York federal court.
Attorneys submitted a letter on behalf of Lively and Reynolds asking a new, more extensive protective order be imposed that would shield “personal, sensitive or proprietary information” from the public after claiming they and their allies have been victimized since the legal battle began. The letter goes on to say that it is ""inevitable"" that the release of more discovery in the case will further violate their privacy, expose them to threats and create ""a climate of possible witness intimidation.""
Lawyers for Lively filed an amended complaint that included new accusations Baldoni’s behavior made at least two additional, unnamed female cast members uncomfortable and that both of those women brought their complaints to Lively, who documented them in writing and reported them to higher-ups on the film (the complaint references Baldoni’s “unwelcome behavior” but does not specify exactly what he is accused of doing).
The suit claims Baldoni was made aware of at least one of the additional cast members' concerns and responded to her in writing at the time, promising ""adjustments would be made”—but alleges he instead launched a PR campaign to discredit any future claims made against him.
Forbes reached out to Baldoni’s attorney, Bryan Freedman, for comment on the new complaint Wednesday.
Baldoni and Lively’s letter to the judge, filed in New York federal court on Thursday, said mediation or reaching a settlement would be “inappropriate” and “premature” for this case, suggesting their legal feud could eventually head to trial.
Hoover, who deactivated her Instagram account as the legal battle between Lively and Baldoni continued to play out, has wiped any photos with Lively or Baldoni from her account. Most posts related to the film at all have been deleted, including an post supporting Lively that went up shortly after she filed her initial lawsuit against Baldoni: ""@blakelively, you have been nothing but honest, kind, supportive and patient since the day we met. Thank you for being exactly the human that you are. Never change. Never wilt,"" she wrote.
During promotion for the “It Ends With Us” film, Hoover appeared to take Lively’s side when a clear rift emerged among the film’s cast and crew. Lively refused to promote the movie alongside Baldoni and the pair were never interviewed or photographed together during its highly publicized press tour, Hoover and most of Lively's co-stars, including Jenny Slate, Brandon Sklenar and Isabela Ferrer, appeared at her side rather than Baldoni’s. Hoover still follows Lively on Instagram, but does not follow Baldoni.
interview of Blake Lively admitting to Forbes she’s ruffled feathers in the film industry by attempting to have more “authorship” over her projects has gone viral. In a resurfaced interview from the 2022 Forbes Power Women's Summit, Lively said just following direction as an actress ""wasn't fulfilling for me"" and that she's received backlash for stepping in and trying to be part of costume design, writing and other aspects of a project. She said she's had writers, producers and directors ""welcome that and invite that,"" and others who resented her for stepping on toes. She also said she hasn’t always upfront with her plans to step in to other parts of a project when she was hired as an actress, and that she “wouldn't reveal that I actually need to have authorship in order to feel fulfilled... Sometimes that might have felt like a rug pull.”
A three-year-old videojoked about ""It Ends With Us"" at the 77th Annual Directors Guild of America (DGA) Awards Saturday night, calling it ""such a terrible movie"" and referencing the Baldoni-Lively lawsuits. ""I loved Wicked. I saw it four times in the first four days,"" Apatow added. ""It was the highest-grossing movie musical of all time. Do you know that? Usually to make that much money, you have to sue Blake Lively.""
Filmmaker Judd Apatowpoked fun at the legal battle, which has played out dramatically in the media over the last six weeks. Handler thanked the pair for providing a ""distraction"" from heavier headlines: “I want to personally extend my gratitude to Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively... I'm grateful. I think we're all grateful. And I think we're good. I think everybody in this room, no matter whose side you're on, we can all agree to accept that there's probably not going to be a sequel. It ends with us, guys.""
Comedian Chelsea Handler, who hosted the Critics’ Choice Awards, alsoFreedman didn’t rule out the idea, calling it a “game time decision” and adding he would seek testimony from anyone who may have relevant information (Freedman also said Swift was present alongside Baldoni, Lively and Ryan Reynolds at a meeting about Lively’s proposed script edits to “It Ends With Us” that is referenced in Baldoni’s lawsuit, though the suit only refers to the alleged attendee as “Taylor” with no last name).
Baldoni’s lawyer suggested in an interview with TMZ he could call on Taylor Swift—a close friend of Blake Lively’s who may have been alluded to in Baldoni’s lawsuit against the actress—to testify once the case goes to trial. After TMZ’s Harvey Levin asked about deposing Swift,sued Lively in Texas federal court for defamation, alleging she falsely claimed in a civil rights complaint and her lawsuit that Wallace participated in an alleged smear campaign against the actress at the behest of Baldoni’s public relations team, which he says caused him “millions of dollars in reputational harm.”

Liman told lawyers for Lively and Baldoni that he would move up the trial date, set for March 2026, if the case continued to be “litigated in the press.” Liman ordered both sides to adhere to the New York Rules of Professional Conduct, which stops lawyers from making public comments that have a “substantial likelihood” of tainting a jury, but stopped short of sanctioning Baldoni’s attorney, Freedman, despite claims from Lively’s team that he has gotten close to defaming her and has made “extrajudicial statements” about her and her character.

Limanfirst published a nearly seven-minute voice note it says Baldoni sent to Lively at 2 a.m. during the filming of ""It Ends With Us,"" in which he allegedly apologizes for not being open enough to script changes she made, admits he is a “a very flawed man” and makes a reference to her breastfeeding her then-newborn child.

Lively's team says the footage fully corroborates her account, and “any woman who has been inappropriately touched in the workplace will recognize Ms. Lively’s discomfort.” Baldoni’s lawyers said the footage proves both actors clearly behaved ""well within the scope of the scene and with mutual respect and professionalism.”
Baldoni’s legal team countered Lively’s claims that he acted inappropriately while filming a slow dancing scene for the film by releasing alawsuit in New York against Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, her publicist Leslie Sloane and Sloane's firm Vision PR alleging his co-star ""tormented"" him, his family and his partners, falsely accused him of sexual harassment and used him as a ""scapegoat"" to dodge the negative press surrounding.

What Did Justin Baldoni Say In A Supposed Voice Note To Blake Lively?
The message, which was obtained by the Daily Mail and has since gone viral on TikTok, appears to be Baldoni apologizing for his reception to changes Lively proposed for a scene in ""It Ends With Us."" Baldoni says his reaction to the changes ""fell short"" and thanked her for telling him how she was feeling about his response, according to the newspaper. ""I f***ed up, that is a fail on my part,"" he appears to say. ""One thing you should know about me is that I am willing to apologize when I fail... I am a very flawed man, as my wife will attest."" Baldoni then appears to talk for almost another five minutes, in which he says there is “nothing more exciting to me” than working with Lively. The message does not specifically say which scene Baldoni is referring to but his lawsuit against Lively mentions tension over a rooftop scene in the film that Lively rewrote and presented to Baldoni as her own work before telling media outlets that her husband, Reynolds, actually wrote it.
Key Background
Baldoni directed and co-starred with Lively in “It Ends With Us,” the movie adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s bestselling book of the same name, which released last August. Rumors of a rift developing between Lively and Baldoni during post-production began to emerge around the movie’s release, and were further fueled during the film's press tour when Lively appeared to avoid mention of Baldoni in interviews. Speculation emerged that there were disputes over creative control and sources told TMZ Baldoni had ""fat-shamed"" Lively by inquiring about her weight, telling an on-set trainer he wanted to avoid injury while lifting the actress in the movie. Baldoni and Lively were never photographed together while promoting “It Ends With Us.” As rumors of a feud grew, Baldoni hired Melissa Nathan, a crisis PR manager who represented Johnny Depp in his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard. According to texts published by The New York Times, Nathan suggested plans including “full social take downs” by creating “threads of theories” and planting pieces in the media of “how horrible Blake is to work with.” Lively said the alleged smear campaign had caused “severe emotional distress” for her and her family, prompting her to back out of hosting the “Saturday Night Live” season 50 premiere.
How Were These Text Messages From Baldoni Released?
Lively's initial complaint included excerpts from thousands of pages of text messages and emails, which were the main focus of the Times article at the center of Baldoni's lawsuit. The text messages were largely between Baldoni, his publicist Jennifer Abel and crisis management expert Melissa Nathan, and were obtained through a civil subpoena, Lively's complaint said. A lawsuit filed by Baldoni's ex-publicist Stephanie Jones, the founder of the Jonesworks publicity firm, days later revealed she was the source of the text messages, which were obtained from Abel’s work phone. In her own lawsuit against Baldoni, Jones claimed Abel was fired for conspiring to steal clients from her firm and Jones later had Abel’s company-issued phone “forensically preserved and examined in detail.” Lively's team then obtained the texts through a subpoena against Jonesworks. The texts show discussions on how to coordinate a social media campaign against Lively, and how Baldoni wanted to feel like Lively ""can be buried” under negative media. The messages show the trio talking about the “shift on social” against Lively, and reveal that Baldoni was aware of the negative messaging against her. Messages from Baldoni also show him encouraging the P.R. team, flagging social media posts for them to use and, in one case, suggesting “flipping the narrative” on a positive story about Lively and Reynolds, according to The Times. In other messages, he reiterates that the campaign needs to be untraceable.
Surprising Fact
Around the time of the “It Ends With Us” premiere, Lively was the subject of intense criticism online targeting how she promoted the film, the opportune release of her haircare line and other behaviors. In one promotional video, Lively encourages the audience to ""grab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see (the movie)."" Fans instantly criticized Lively's upbeat tone and claimed she was attempting to promote the movie as a lighthearted love story, cheapening the movie's serious take on domestic abuse. Comments on the video attacked Lively—""shame on you and your PR team for turning a blind eye,"" one said—but praised Baldoni for how he handled promotion. Lively was also criticized for seeming to promote her newly launched hair-care line, Blake Brown, off the back of the film, but it was later revealed that the two were never supposed to launch at the same time. Production delays caused by Hollywood strikes in 2023 pushed the premiere of “It Ends With Us,” then coinciding with the predetermined launch date of the brand. At the same time, Lively was freshly criticized for her reaction to an interviewer in a resurfaced 2016 clip. Lively’s lawsuits claim the public’s attacks were part of the smear campaign she says was orchestrated against her.
Tangent
A number of celebrities have come out to support Lively since she filed her initial complaint, including Hoover, Lively’s “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” co-stars and actress Amber Heard, who claimed to be a victim of a similar social media takedown. Hoover, who The Times reported also refused to do press with Baldoni, posted to Instagram after Lively first made her allegations to call her ""nothing but honest, kind, supportive and patient."" America Ferrera, Alexis Bledel and Amber Tamblyn, who starred alongside Lively in her 2005 breakout role in ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"" slammed the “vindictive effort ensued to discredit her voice” and Heard said she has seen similar social media campaigns ""firsthand and up close,” calling it ""horrifying and destructive.” Actresses Kate Beckinsale and Abigail Breslin shared their own stories of harassment and retaliation in the wake of Lively's lawsuit, and director Paul Feig posted that Lively ""did not deserve any of this smear campaign.” Lively's ""It Ends with Us"" costar Brandon Sklenar posted a link to the initial New York Times story and Jenny Slate, another co-star in the film, said she stands by her ""loyal friend."" Amy Schumer posted a story on Instagram that said, “I believe Blake.” Political influencer Candace Owens posted in support of Baldoni after he was stripped of his Vital Voices award, writing that he should ""have his day in court"" before such drastic measures are taken.","Baldoni Vs. Lively Feud: 14 Women’s Advocacy Groups Back Lively In New Amicus Brief Topline Blake Lively made a rare address of her legal battle on her Instagram on Monday night, thanking supporters and the women’s rights groups that backed her with amicus curiae briefs after a federal judge dismissed her “It Ends With Us” director and co-star Justin Baldoni’s suit accusing her of defamation and extortion. (Here are in-depth explanations for Lively’s claims and Baldoni’s claims.) Timeline Lively said she and the 19 women’s groups that backed her in court “stood proudly” in “defending women’s rights to speak up for their safety,” stating she felt the “pain of a retaliatory lawsuit” and the “manufactured shame that tries to break us,” hours after a judge dismissed Baldoni’s defamation and extortion lawsuit filed against her. Judge Lewis Liman dismissed Baldoni’s $400 million lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds and his $250 million lawsuit against The New York Times, after Baldoni alleged they each conspired in a “vitriolic smear campaign” to end his career—Lively’s attorneys Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb celebrated Liman’s ruling as a “total victory and a complete vindication.” Liman ruled Baldoni did not allege Lively was responsible for comments made outside of her civil suit against him, which are “privileged,” while Reynolds, Lively’s publicist Leslie Sloan and the Times published or made other statements about Baldoni they believed were true “based on the information available to them.” In a new amicus curiae brief, 14 women’s rights groups, including the National Organization for Women and its New York City chapter, the National Network to End Domestic Violence and the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, supported Lively’s claims of sexual harassment against Baldoni while accusing him of using the “DARVO” tactic—deny, attack, reverse victim and offender—to smear and silence Lively. Lively’s legal team has portrayed Baldoni—who has advocated for women throughout has career, including in a viral Ted Talk in 2017—as turning his back on his feminist beliefs: “Baldoni is now contradicting years of his own public persona,” Lively’s legal team told Forbes in a statement, citing Baldoni’s legal team’s attempt to challenge the amicus briefs. Baldoni’s lawyers said in a legal filing Lively’s counsel informed them she has requested to withdraw her claim of emotional distress made in her lawsuit against Baldoni, which his lawyers say was done after his legal team requested she provide medical and mental health records to demonstrate the distress she says she suffered. Baldoni’s lawyers also said in their letter to the judge they oppose Lively’s request to withdraw her emotional distress claim without prejudice, which means she can refile the claim at a later time, though Lively’s lawyers dismissed Baldoni’s legal team’s letter as a “a press stunt” and that they are “streamlining and focusing” Lively’s case. Lively’s legal team accused Baldoni and his lawyers of trying to “prevent women’s rights groups from being heard” in a statement to Forbes, alleging they are trying to “shred a law designed to protect all victims just to make sure they ‘bury’ one,” referring to the #MeToo law Lively invoked. Daily Mail, stating the set was “tense” and filming took longer than expected, adding Lively was more “closed off” on set than when he previously worked with her on the 2018 film, “A Simple Favor.” Thomas Canestraro, who acted as Baldoni’s stunt double in “It Ends With Us,” spoke with theBaldoni and his lawyers sent a letter asking the judge to dismiss amicus briefs filed by women’s groups, alleging they are “irrelevant” to Lively’s motion to dismiss Baldoni’s lawsuit, while accusing Lively’s legal team of using the briefs as a “vehicle to renew [Liively's] public attacks” against Baldoni and as more of a “publicity stunt for Lively than a useful aid for the Court at the pleading stage.” amicus briefs supporting Lively’s invocation of a new California law that is meant to protect sexual assault and harassment survivors from defamation lawsuits, commonly known as the #MeToo law after the Hollywood anti-sexual harassment movement. San Francisco-based Equal Rights Advocates and former government employee and sexual harassment survivor Elyse Dorsey filedVariety and Deadline reported, after previously requesting texts between Swift and Lively, which they argued would show that Lively attempted to extort Swift for a public show of support amid her legal battle, though Lively’s legal team denied this (Forbes has reached out to representatives for both Lively and Baldoni’s legal teams for comment, though Lively’s lawyers told Deadline they are “pleased” the “inappropriate subpoenas” were withdrawn). Baldoni’s lawyers withdrew the subpoena,Variety and NBC News that beyond the inclusion of her song “My Tears Ricochet” in a “It Ends With Us” trailer, Swift had no involvement in the making of the movie. Taylor Swift was subpoenaed in Baldoni’s lawsuit against Lively, which includes texts from Lively that appear to refer to Swift as “one of her dragons,” though representatives for the billionaire singer argued she should not be involved in the dispute, tellingoutlets she plans to take the stand and testify once her trial begins: “The ultimate moment for a plaintiff's story to be told is at trial. We expect that to be the case here. So we would, of course, expect her to be a witness at her trial. Of course she’s going to testify,” Gottlieb told People (Forbes has reached out to Lively’s legal team for comment). Lively’s legal team told multiple newstelevised interview since filing her lawsuit against Baldoni to promote “Another Simple Favor” on Seth Meyers’ late night show, in which she acknowledged she can’t discuss much about her legal battle with Baldoni—whom she did not address by name—but stated she has faced the “highest highs and the lowest lows of my life” over the past “intense year,” adding she feels “fortunate” she has been able to speak about her experience because many women are “afraid to share their experiences” or do not have the opportunity to. Lively gave her firstpositive reviews from critics. “Another Simple Favor,” Lively’s first film since “It Ends With Us” and a sequel to the 2018 film “A Simple Favor,” premiered on Amazon Prime Video and received mostlyBaldoni’s lawyers submitted a letter to the court opposing Marvel’s request to quash the subpoena, doubling down on their claim that ‘“Nicepool” is a defamatory and mocking portrayal of Baldoni” and that such a portrayal could establish malice for his defamation claim, while accusing Marvel’s counsel of “refusing to engage” with Baldoni’s Wayfarer Studios to resolve the dispute. allegation that a character in the 2024 Marvel film “Deadpool & Wolverine,” Nicepool, was crafted by Ryan Reynolds as a caricature of Baldoni, Marvel Studios sent a letter to Liman asking the court to squash Baldoni’s subpoena for relevant documents, stating the claims are irrelevant to Baldoni’s claims of defamation and that releasing confidential Marvel documents would harm the studio. In response to Baldoni’samended response to Jones’ lawsuit against Baldoni, which she filed in December accusing him of defamation and breach of contract, Baldoni accused Jones of colluding with Lively to file a “sham legal proceeding” in New York court in September under a company affiliated with Lively, Vanzan Inc., against unnamed defendants as a “transparent ploy to obtain subpoena power” without Lively’s name attached so the parties could obtain text messages—which were central to Lively’s claims, and the basis for a New York Times story—sent among Baldoni’s team. In anIn a statement to Deadline, Jones’s lawyer Kristen Tahler accused Baldoni’s team of “presenting zero new evidence” and of conducting “a desperate ploy by a team who tonight all but admits they’re in trouble.” Lively attended the Time 100 Gala as an honoree, where she made a speech apparently alluding to her ongoing legal battle: “I have so much to say about the last two years of my life, but tonight is not the forum,"" Lively said, in a speech in which she largely focused on abuse against women, a central theme of “It Ends With Us,” and revealed her mother was a victim of abuse. 60 Minutes Australia,” stating she felt Lively “smelled [Baldoni’s] kindness, mistook it for weakness and tried to take advantage and take power,” alleging Lively “tried to” take control of the film, resulting in a “massive compromise” of Baldoni’s vision for the movie. “It Ends With Us” storyboard artist Talia Spencer defended Baldoni in an interview with “PageSix Lively wore a “full hospital gown, black shorts and torso-covering prosthetic” and was not “nearly nude” as she had claimed in her complaint. An actor who played a small role in “It Ends With Us” as Lively’s character’s gynecologist pushed back against Lively’s description of a birthing scene in her lawsuit as “invasive and humiliating,” tellingIn a counterclaim to Jones’ December lawsuit against Baldoni and Abel, Baldoni alleged Jones attempted to undermine Abel’s authority as a PR representative for Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios production company, claiming she suddenly terminated Abel from her PR firm, seized her phone and leaked texts to Lively’s team, which the lawsuit says was done in response to Abel voicing her intent to leave Jones’ firm and Jones’ fear she would take Baldoni as a client with her. In her motion to dismiss, Lively slammed Baldoni’s “vengeful and rambling lawsuit” as a “profound abuse of the legal process,” urging the court to “dismiss all claims against Ms. Lively with prejudice, deny leave to amend, and award Ms. Lively all relief sought,” including attorney’s fees and damages for “reputational and emotional harm.” Reynolds filed a motion to dismiss Baldoni’s lawsuit, in which he is named as a co-defendant, alleging Baldoni’s lawsuit does not prove Reynolds defamed him and is instead “a list of grievances attempting to shame Mr. Reynolds for being the man Mr. Baldoni has built his brand pretending to be.” premiere of “Another Simple Favor,” a sequel to the 2018 film “A Simple Favor,” where she received a warm reception from the crowd and spoke primarily about her work on the film, though co-star Anna Kendrick dodged a question that appeared to allude to Lively’s legal battle, and one protester held up a sign that said “Justice for Justin Baldoni” outside the theater. Lively attended the South by Southwesthearing Thursday, Lively’s attorneys argued certain information should be treated as highly classified “attorney’s eyes only” material, which lawyer Sigrid McCawley said would help minimize the risk of “irreparable harm if marginal conversations with high profile individuals with no relevance to the case were to fall into wrong hands”—apparently suggesting messages between Lively and celebrity friends may leak. The judge did not rule on the request Thursday. At aThough it’s unclear which “high profile individuals” McCawley was referring to, Baldoni’s lawyer Bryan Freedman has previously suggested he could request Lively’s friend Taylor Swift testify, after she appeared to be referred to in Baldoni’s lawsuit. Los Angeles Times published an investigative report on Baldoni’s career, citing multiple unnamed employees at his Wayfarer Studios production company, some of whom said he injected “toxic positivity” and his Bahai faith into the workplace culture in a way that felt “professionally inappropriate.” TheRepresentatives for Baldoni and Wayfarer told the Los Angeles Times there have “never been any reported complaints regarding the workplace culture” and Wayfarer’s work is rooted in “various faiths and backgrounds.” motion to dismiss Justin Baldoni’s $400 million case against the newspaper provided “substantial grounds,” suggesting the lawsuit—in which Baldoni accused the Times of working with Lively’s team to smear him—could be dismissed. Lewis Liman, a U.S. district judge, said the New York Times’Shapiro, who formerly served as the CIA’s deputy chief of staff between 2013 and 2015 before starting his own strategic consulting firm, will advise Lively’s litigation team on legal communications relating to the lawsuit she filed against Baldoni in New York federal court. Attorneys submitted a letter on behalf of Lively and Reynolds asking a new, more extensive protective order be imposed that would shield “personal, sensitive or proprietary information” from the public after claiming they and their allies have been victimized since the legal battle began. The letter goes on to say that it is ""inevitable"" that the release of more discovery in the case will further violate their privacy, expose them to threats and create ""a climate of possible witness intimidation."" Lawyers for Lively filed an amended complaint that included new accusations Baldoni’s behavior made at least two additional, unnamed female cast members uncomfortable and that both of those women brought their complaints to Lively, who documented them in writing and reported them to higher-ups on the film (the complaint references Baldoni’s “unwelcome behavior” but does not specify exactly what he is accused of doing). The suit claims Baldoni was made aware of at least one of the additional cast members' concerns and responded to her in writing at the time, promising ""adjustments would be made”—but alleges he instead launched a PR campaign to discredit any future claims made against him. Forbes reached out to Baldoni’s attorney, Bryan Freedman, for comment on the new complaint Wednesday. Baldoni and Lively’s letter to the judge, filed in New York federal court on Thursday, said mediation or reaching a settlement would be “inappropriate” and “premature” for this case, suggesting their legal feud could eventually head to trial. Hoover, who deactivated her Instagram account as the legal battle between Lively and Baldoni continued to play out, has wiped any photos with Lively or Baldoni from her account. Most posts related to the film at all have been deleted, including an post supporting Lively that went up shortly after she filed her initial lawsuit against Baldoni: ""@blakelively, you have been nothing but honest, kind, supportive and patient since the day we met. Thank you for being exactly the human that you are. Never change. Never wilt,"" she wrote. During promotion for the “It Ends With Us” film, Hoover appeared to take Lively’s side when a clear rift emerged among the film’s cast and crew. Lively refused to promote the movie alongside Baldoni and the pair were never interviewed or photographed together during its highly publicized press tour, Hoover and most of Lively's co-stars, including Jenny Slate, Brandon Sklenar and Isabela Ferrer, appeared at her side rather than Baldoni’s. Hoover still follows Lively on Instagram, but does not follow Baldoni. interview of Blake Lively admitting to Forbes she’s ruffled feathers in the film industry by attempting to have more “authorship” over her projects has gone viral. In a resurfaced interview from the 2022 Forbes Power Women's Summit, Lively said just following direction as an actress ""wasn't fulfilling for me"" and that she's received backlash for stepping in and trying to be part of costume design, writing and other aspects of a project. She said she's had writers, producers and directors ""welcome that and invite that,"" and others who resented her for stepping on toes. She also said she hasn’t always upfront with her plans to step in to other parts of a project when she was hired as an actress, and that she “wouldn't reveal that I actually need to have authorship in order to feel fulfilled... Sometimes that might have felt like a rug pull.” A three-year-old videojoked about ""It Ends With Us"" at the 77th Annual Directors Guild of America (DGA) Awards Saturday night, calling it ""such a terrible movie"" and referencing the Baldoni-Lively lawsuits. ""I loved Wicked. I saw it four times in the first four days,"" Apatow added. ""It was the highest-grossing movie musical of all time. Do you know that? Usually to make that much money, you have to sue Blake Lively."" Filmmaker Judd Apatowpoked fun at the legal battle, which has played out dramatically in the media over the last six weeks. Handler thanked the pair for providing a ""distraction"" from heavier headlines: “I want to personally extend my gratitude to Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively... I'm grateful. I think we're all grateful. And I think we're good. I think everybody in this room, no matter whose side you're on, we can all agree to accept that there's probably not going to be a sequel. It ends with us, guys."" Comedian Chelsea Handler, who hosted the Critics’ Choice Awards, alsoFreedman didn’t rule out the idea, calling it a “game time decision” and adding he would seek testimony from anyone who may have relevant information (Freedman also said Swift was present alongside Baldoni, Lively and Ryan Reynolds at a meeting about Lively’s proposed script edits to “It Ends With Us” that is referenced in Baldoni’s lawsuit, though the suit only refers to the alleged attendee as “Taylor” with no last name). Baldoni’s lawyer suggested in an interview with TMZ he could call on Taylor Swift—a close friend of Blake Lively’s who may have been alluded to in Baldoni’s lawsuit against the actress—to testify once the case goes to trial. After TMZ’s Harvey Levin asked about deposing Swift,sued Lively in Texas federal court for defamation, alleging she falsely claimed in a civil rights complaint and her lawsuit that Wallace participated in an alleged smear campaign against the actress at the behest of Baldoni’s public relations team, which he says caused him “millions of dollars in reputational harm.” Jed Wallace, owner of the crisis PR firm Street Relations,“A Simple Favor 2,” Lively's latest film, will open at the SXSW Film and TV Festival next month, Director Paul Feig said, after rumors the film had been shelved, partially due to the Lively/Baldoni legal battle. Liman told lawyers for Lively and Baldoni that he would move up the trial date, set for March 2026, if the case continued to be “litigated in the press.” Liman ordered both sides to adhere to the New York Rules of Professional Conduct, which stops lawyers from making public comments that have a “substantial likelihood” of tainting a jury, but stopped short of sanctioning Baldoni’s attorney, Freedman, despite claims from Lively’s team that he has gotten close to defaming her and has made “extrajudicial statements” about her and her character. website dedicated to supporting his lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds that links to to an amended complaint filed on Jan. 31 and contains a timeline of events outlining what he says happened on the set of “It Ends With Us,” including corresponding text messages, emails and a statement Baldoni has said he was pressured into releasing by Reynolds and Lively that would have seen him take the blame for the ""troubled production"" of the movie (he refused to put out the statement). In addition to the statement, Baldoni released a text message exchange with Lively that showed she chose not to meet with the on-set intimacy coordinator he hired, leaving him to relay uncomfortable information from the meeting on his own. Baldoni’s team published aLawyers for Lively and Reynolds said in a letter to Liman that they plan to move to dismiss the lawsuit filed against them at a pre-trial conference scheduled for Monday, Feb. 3. The Hollywood Reporter cited unnamed sources in reporting Baldoni has ""lost three jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars” since Lively first filed suit against him in December and that an in-the-works ""Pac-Man"" movie project he was set to direct is now in jeopardy. told Lively and Baldoni's lawyers to prepare for a March 9, 2026 trial date and set a pretrial conference to discuss, among other things, complaints from Lively's team about the conduct of Baldoni's lawyer. Lively's lawyers have claimed Freedman is trying to paint potential jurors by creating a website to release communication between the two actors and documents from set, and accused him of making an ""endless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements."" Limanfirst published a nearly seven-minute voice note it says Baldoni sent to Lively at 2 a.m. during the filming of ""It Ends With Us,"" in which he allegedly apologizes for not being open enough to script changes she made, admits he is a “a very flawed man” and makes a reference to her breastfeeding her then-newborn child. The Daily Mail10-minute video from set that includes three takes of the same scene, which Baldoni's team says is the entirety of the footage shot for that scene, during which Lively alleged in a lawsuit Baldoni “leaned forward and slowly dragged his lips from her ear and down her neck as he said, ‘it smells so good.'” The footage shows a similar interaction, where Baldoni is seen nuzzling Lively’s neck, and she says, ""I’m probably getting spray-tan on you,"" to which he responds, ""It smells good."" Lively's team says the footage fully corroborates her account, and “any woman who has been inappropriately touched in the workplace will recognize Ms. Lively’s discomfort.” Baldoni’s lawyers said the footage proves both actors clearly behaved ""well within the scope of the scene and with mutual respect and professionalism.” Baldoni’s legal team countered Lively’s claims that he acted inappropriately while filming a slow dancing scene for the film by releasing alawsuit in New York against Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, her publicist Leslie Sloane and Sloane's firm Vision PR alleging his co-star ""tormented"" him, his family and his partners, falsely accused him of sexual harassment and used him as a ""scapegoat"" to dodge the negative press surrounding. He also pushed back on claims he sexually harassed her, instead claiming she ""calculatingly devised"" fake stories to destroy his reputation and livelihood, seized control of the film he was directing and set out to damage his career and Wayfarer Studios ""if they did not bend to her incessant demands” (Here’s more on Baldoni’s lawsuit). Baldoni filed a federalDeadline reported Baldoni's former publicist Stephanie Jones, who sued the actor and a handful of others for defamation and breach of contract in December, has issued subpoenas to WhatsApp, Signal, website hosts Hostinger and Name Cheap, digital publishing platform AnyFlip and chatbot company Gab AI in attempts to discover who may have been behind posts and websites aimed at harming Lively and Baldoni’s reputations. responded to viral rumors the film had been shelved ""indefinitely,"" partially due to the Lively/Baldoni legal battle, calling it ""total BS"" and confirming the film ""is finished and coming out soon."" Feig, who directed Lively's upcoming film ""A Simple Favor 2,""interview with Baldoni’s attorney, Bryan Freedman, TMZ founder Harvey Levin said about the co-stars’ competing accusations about online campaigns to damage one another’s reputation: “Both sides tried to skew this story. We've been on the recipient end of that ... It has happened on both sides in the Blake Lively, Justin Baldoni war. Both sides.” Freedman responded by saying, “That’s good to know.” (In recent days, Freedman has denied Lively’s allegations that she faced a smear campaign by Baldoni’s PR team, claiming Lively’s team was instead working to smear Baldoni.) In anplans to sue Lively “into oblivion” and pushed back on several of the actresses’ allegations, accusing Lively of not reading the source material for the film, refuting claims she was sexually harassed and accusing her of orchestrating her own smear campaign against Baldoni. The interview also included newly released sound from a voice note from Baldoni explaining that he was ""sent to the basement"" of the film's premiere because Lively ""didn't want me anywhere near her or the rest of the cast” (Here’s more on what Freedman said on Kelly’s show.) Freedman appeared on Megyn Kelly’s YouTube show to discuss Baldoni’stold NBC’s ""Today"" he ""absolutely"" plans to file suit against Lively after she alleged she was subjected to ""sexually inappropriate behavior"" by Baldoni on the set of their 2024 film, but wouldn't say exactly what the countersuit would allege, though denied Lively’s claim that Baldoni and his team launched a smear campaign against the actress. Freedmantold Yahoo Entertainment. “I also don’t want to give (Baldoni’s) name any — I’m mad I even know his name, to be honest with you, so I don’t need to say it anymore.” Glaser, the first solo female to ever host the Golden Globes, warned viwers in advance that she wouldn't be poking fun of Baldoni and Lively while on stage. “I think the Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni thing is such a hot-button thing right now that even a mere mention of it will seem like I could be on the wrong side of things, even though I would never be,” GlaserThe New York Times for the paper's reporting on Lively's allegations, accusing the outlet of having ""cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful 'untouchable' Hollywood elites""—Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds (on Jan. 31, Baldoni added defamation allegations against the Times to his sweeping lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds, and his attorney said he would drop the original suit against the paper).

Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here. What Did Justin Baldoni Say In A Supposed Voice Note To Blake Lively? The message, which was obtained by the Daily Mail and has since gone viral on TikTok, appears to be Baldoni apologizing for his reception to changes Lively proposed for a scene in ""It Ends With Us."" Baldoni says his reaction to the changes ""fell short"" and thanked her for telling him how she was feeling about his response, according to the newspaper. ""I f***ed up, that is a fail on my part,"" he appears to say. ""One thing you should know about me is that I am willing to apologize when I fail... I am a very flawed man, as my wife will attest."" Baldoni then appears to talk for almost another five minutes, in which he says there is “nothing more exciting to me” than working with Lively. The message does not specifically say which scene Baldoni is referring to but his lawsuit against Lively mentions tension over a rooftop scene in the film that Lively rewrote and presented to Baldoni as her own work before telling media outlets that her husband, Reynolds, actually wrote it. Key Background Baldoni directed and co-starred with Lively in “It Ends With Us,” the movie adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s bestselling book of the same name, which released last August. Rumors of a rift developing between Lively and Baldoni during post-production began to emerge around the movie’s release, and were further fueled during the film's press tour when Lively appeared to avoid mention of Baldoni in interviews. Speculation emerged that there were disputes over creative control and sources told TMZ Baldoni had ""fat-shamed"" Lively by inquiring about her weight, telling an on-set trainer he wanted to avoid injury while lifting the actress in the movie. Baldoni and Lively were never photographed together while promoting “It Ends With Us.” As rumors of a feud grew, Baldoni hired Melissa Nathan, a crisis PR manager who represented Johnny Depp in his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard. According to texts published by The New York Times, Nathan suggested plans including “full social take downs” by creating “threads of theories” and planting pieces in the media of “how horrible Blake is to work with.” Lively said the alleged smear campaign had caused “severe emotional distress” for her and her family, prompting her to back out of hosting the “Saturday Night Live” season 50 premiere. How Were These Text Messages From Baldoni Released? Lively's initial complaint included excerpts from thousands of pages of text messages and emails, which were the main focus of the Times article at the center of Baldoni's lawsuit. The text messages were largely between Baldoni, his publicist Jennifer Abel and crisis management expert Melissa Nathan, and were obtained through a civil subpoena, Lively's complaint said. A lawsuit filed by Baldoni's ex-publicist Stephanie Jones, the founder of the Jonesworks publicity firm, days later revealed she was the source of the text messages, which were obtained from Abel’s work phone. In her own lawsuit against Baldoni, Jones claimed Abel was fired for conspiring to steal clients from her firm and Jones later had Abel’s company-issued phone “forensically preserved and examined in detail.” Lively's team then obtained the texts through a subpoena against Jonesworks. The texts show discussions on how to coordinate a social media campaign against Lively, and how Baldoni wanted to feel like Lively ""can be buried” under negative media. The messages show the trio talking about the “shift on social” against Lively, and reveal that Baldoni was aware of the negative messaging against her. Messages from Baldoni also show him encouraging the P.R. team, flagging social media posts for them to use and, in one case, suggesting “flipping the narrative” on a positive story about Lively and Reynolds, according to The Times. In other messages, he reiterates that the campaign needs to be untraceable. Surprising Fact Around the time of the “It Ends With Us” premiere, Lively was the subject of intense criticism online targeting how she promoted the film, the opportune release of her haircare line and other behaviors. In one promotional video, Lively encourages the audience to ""grab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see (the movie)."" Fans instantly criticized Lively's upbeat tone and claimed she was attempting to promote the movie as a lighthearted love story, cheapening the movie's serious take on domestic abuse. Comments on the video attacked Lively—""shame on you and your PR team for turning a blind eye,"" one said—but praised Baldoni for how he handled promotion. Lively was also criticized for seeming to promote her newly launched hair-care line, Blake Brown, off the back of the film, but it was later revealed that the two were never supposed to launch at the same time. Production delays caused by Hollywood strikes in 2023 pushed the premiere of “It Ends With Us,” then coinciding with the predetermined launch date of the brand. At the same time, Lively was freshly criticized for her reaction to an interviewer in a resurfaced 2016 clip. Lively’s lawsuits claim the public’s attacks were part of the smear campaign she says was orchestrated against her. Tangent A number of celebrities have come out to support Lively since she filed her initial complaint, including Hoover, Lively’s “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” co-stars and actress Amber Heard, who claimed to be a victim of a similar social media takedown. Hoover, who The Times reported also refused to do press with Baldoni, posted to Instagram after Lively first made her allegations to call her ""nothing but honest, kind, supportive and patient."" America Ferrera, Alexis Bledel and Amber Tamblyn, who starred alongside Lively in her 2005 breakout role in ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"" slammed the “vindictive effort ensued to discredit her voice” and Heard said she has seen similar social media campaigns ""firsthand and up close,” calling it ""horrifying and destructive.” Actresses Kate Beckinsale and Abigail Breslin shared their own stories of harassment and retaliation in the wake of Lively's lawsuit, and director Paul Feig posted that Lively ""did not deserve any of this smear campaign.” Lively's ""It Ends with Us"" costar Brandon Sklenar posted a link to the initial New York Times story and Jenny Slate, another co-star in the film, said she stands by her ""loyal friend."" Amy Schumer posted a story on Instagram that said, “I believe Blake.” Political influencer Candace Owens posted in support of Baldoni after he was stripped of his Vital Voices award, writing that he should ""have his day in court"" before such drastic measures are taken.",Neutral,0.9987

Forbes,Halle Bailey And DDG Custody Battle: DDG Asks Judge To Block Bailey From Leaving Country With Son,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/06/05/halle-bailey-and-ddg-custody-battle-ddg-asks-judge-to-block-bailey-from-leaving-country-with-son/,,"Topline
The custody battle between singer and actress Halle Bailey and her ex-boyfriend, the rapper DDG, has heated up as DDG asked a judge to block Bailey from taking their infant son with her to Italy, alleging she poses a risk to their son’s safety because she has previously threatened self-harm.
Key Facts
DDG requested a restraining order against Bailey in Los Angeles court on Wednesday and asked a judge to block her from taking Halo, their 17-month-old son, to Italy with her, alleging Bailey would pose “imminent emotional and psychological risk to the minor child based on repeated, documented threats of self-harm.”
DDG, whose real name is Darryl Dwayne Granberry Jr., alleged in court filings Bailey once took his firearm and left their house while threatening to harm herself, stating she “environment of emotional distress and danger within the home,” and his filings contain text messages appearing to show Bailey threatening self-harm, Billboard reported.
Bailey, 25, and DDG, 27, have been locked in a custody battle over their son since Bailey filed a restraining order against him in May, accusing him of physical and verbal abuse, including an alleged incident in which he slammed her face on a steering wheel in front of their son.
Bailey also alleged DDG has riled up his fans to send online hate to Bailey by accusing her of keeping their son from him on his livestreams, and she detailed another incident in which she filed a police report after DDG allegedly threw her phone from a car window.
A judge granted Bailey temporary custody of their son in May.
The couple split in October 2024 after nearly three years of dating, at the time stating they were “still best friends” and planned to co-parent their son.
Forbes has reached out to lawyers representing both Bailey and DDG for comment.
What To Watch For
Bailey is slated to depart for Italy to film a movie for two months on June 7, Billboard reported, and a judge is expected to rule on whether she will be allowed to bring her son. The court also set June 24 as the date for a hearing on Bailey and DDG’s restraining orders against one another.
Key Background
Bailey and DDG began dating in January 2022, though they did not publicly acknowledge their relationship on social media until March of that year. Bailey gave birth to their son in December 2023, announcing his birth in an Instagram post the following month. Bailey had largely kept her pregnancy a secret despite fan speculation, stating months after her child’s birth at the Essence Black Women in Hollywood ceremony she “had no obligation to expose him, me or my family to that unyielding spotlight.”
Who Is Ddg?
DDG first started his career in entertainment as a YouTube content creator, posting vlogs and prank videos. He dropped out of college in 2016, stating he made more money from his YouTube careers, after which he started releasing music. He has since released four albums, including his only charting hit in the United States, ""Moonwalking in Calabasas,” and he has collaborated with artists including Lil Yachty, Gunna and DaBaby. He maintains active profiles on YouTube and streaming platform Twitch, where he has 3.6 million subscribers and 1.6 million followers, respectively.
Who Is Halle Bailey?
Bailey first rose to fame as one half of Chloe x Halle, a singing duo with her older sister, Chloe Bailey. The two first garnered attention for singing Beyoncé songs on their YouTube channel, racking up more than 22 million views on a cover of her song “Pretty Hurts” in 2013. Bailey and her sister have been considered protégés of Beyoncé, whose company Parkwood Entertainment signed them for a six-album deal in 2016. Chloe x Halle have released two studio albums, “The Kids Are Alright” in 2018 and “Ungodly Hour” in 2020, though they have since pursued solo careers. Halle Bailey achieved wider recognition for a series of high-profile acting roles, including the lead role in “The Little Mermaid” live-action remake and a supporting role in “The Color Purple,” in 2023. Her role in the former film made her the target of racist backlash from critics who felt the casting of a Black Ariel was unfaithful to the original animated film, prompting Disney to defend her and Bailey to say it is important for her to “represent all of these little young Black and brown boys and girls.”

Forbes,Small Businesses Hit Pause On Hiring Amid Tariff Confusion,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2025/06/05/small-businesses-hit-pause-on-hiring-amid-tariff-confusion/,,"The Trump administration said tariffs would bring jobs back to America, especially for small businesses. Maybe that’ll happen someday. For now, however, they’ve mostly brought confusion and slowed hiring on Main Street.
That’s according to the May jobs report from the National Federation of Independent Business, a small business advocacy group. The report is based on a random sample of 485 NFIB member firms surveyed throughout the month.
The findings show a labor market that’s softening. Just 34% of small businesses said they had unfilled job openings. That’s down from nearly 50% two years ago, but unchanged since April–President Trump first unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2, marking the start of what has been two months of confusion, with Trump delaying some levies, imposing others, and making additional threats. More worrisome is that small businesses aren’t planning to hire much either. Just 12% of owners said they anticipate creating new jobs in the next three months, a level which NFIB says is “in weak territory compared to recent history.”
Seven of the nine industries NFIB tracks saw year-over-year declines in the share of firms with job openings. Construction fell to 48% from 54%. Transportation dropped to 43% from 52%. Professional services saw the sharpest decline, from 47% last May to just 18% today, the lowest of any sector. Retail and agriculture were the only categories to buck the trend, rising by 1 and 2 percentage points, respectively. The slight gain in agriculture may reflect hiring pressure from the administration’s immigration crackdown.
That weakening in labor demand has started to show up elsewhere. Just 16% of small business owners cited labor quality as their biggest problem, down 3 points from April and the lowest since April 2020. NFIB suggested that recent Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts to the federal workforce may be boosting the labor pool. With more applicants, fewer firms feel compelled to offer raises. Only 26% of businesses reported raising wages in May, down 7 points from April and the weakest reading in more than four years. NFIB concluded that labor cost pressure “is easing,” which may help contain inflation.
But the bigger picture is more worrying. Tariff threats are holding back hiring. That hasn’t caused major problems yet, but September looms. That’s when laid-off federal workers will stop getting paid. If tariffs are still unresolved by then, small business hiring may continue to sag. And if that happens, the unemployment rate, which has held near 4% for a year, could finally break higher.

Forbes,How An Unassuming Geologist Cracked The Global Fertilizer Cartel,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2025/05/30/how-an-unassuming-geologist-cracked-the-global-fertilizer-cartel/,,"Michigan is sitting on a motherlode of potash and Ted Pagano is using $1.3 billion in government funds to mine it and grab market share away from Canada and Russia.
The eureka moment came in 2012, when professor emeritus William Harrison of the University of Western Michigan invited Ted Pagano, then a 35-year-old freelance geologist, to his 27,000-square-foot geological repository in Kalamazoo. A rock nerd’s heaven, the warehouse’s heavy-duty shelves feature crates of minerals from across the state. But Pagano was there to see something specific: the 80 pallets of rock cores donated in 2008 by the Mosaic Company, a large ($11.1 billion in 2024 sales) NYSE-listed potash specialist. Cores are standardized cylinders of rock, three feet long and four inches in diameter. These were recovered from some 75 wells drilled back in the early 1980s to depths 8,000 feet beneath Osceola and Mecosta counties, a sparsely populated swath of central Michigan, into a layer of rock rich in minerals deposited by an ocean that evaporated millions of years ago. Those minerals include salt (sodium chloride) and potash (mostly potassium oxide), which farmers prize as a fertilizer. It’s a critical mineral—the U.S. uses 5.3 million tons annually and imports 95% of it, mostly from Canada.
Pagano was excited to see these cores because he hoped they would prove his hunch: that Mosaic had been sitting on a potash motherlode in Michigan far bigger than anyone realized. He suspected that the deposit, if properly developed, could provide 1 million tons of fertilizer per year for American farmers. That would be nearly seven times the volume that Mosaic’s little 150,000-ton-per-year plant in Hersey, Michigan, was producing. Putting up $70,000 of his own money, Pagano had formed Michigan Potash & Salt Company and was already leasing up mineral rights from ranchers and farmers in the area. Even so, Pagano says, “I went to the core lab with skepticism.”
Harrison and Pagano cut open sealed plastic bags to extract rock wrapped in newspapers from 1984. Testing revealed thick deposits of some of the highest-purity potash deposits ever discovered. They were especially excited when they opened the cores from a well called Stein 1-7. It had been drilled miles from the area considered the sweet spot, so Pagano thought the odds were high that these cores would show low concentrations of potash. Instead, they were just as good. This was proof that the actual extent of the Michigan potash deposit was considerably larger than even experts like Harrison had expected. Pagano began leasing like crazy: Soon he had a position covering 15,500 acres (about 24 square miles) of what has proven to be one of the biggest potash deposits in the United States.
“I was certain the Stein well would be a poor showing. Seeing it was just as good as the best well was astounding,” says Pagano, now 49. His Michigan Potash is on the cusp of closing on $1.8 billion of financing for a new mine, including a $1.3 billion loan from the Department of Energy and $500 million in equity being arranged by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. If all goes well, the mine will be churning out 1 million tons per year of potash (worth $350 million) and 1.3 million tons of salt (worth $80 million) by the end of the decade. With a resource base proven to be 130 million tons, they could keep that up for a century or more—and make Pagano, who owns 65%, very rich. Even now his stake is worth at least $300 million.
Pagano grew up in Greeley, Colorado, the son of a tax preparer and an assistant librarian. After graduating from Notre Dame in 1997, he earned a master’s degree in petroleum engineering from the Colorado School of Mines. He got his start in the oil industry as a roustabout in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, then worked as a geologist for Alaska’s Bristol Bay Native Corporation. (He is part Aleut, the indigenous people of the Aleutian Islands.) From there he worked at Texaco, Chevron and Anadarko drilling shale oil wells in Colorado. In 2008, at age 33, he struck out on his own, initially planning to lease prospective oilfields in North Dakota’s Bakken shale region, but land prices—which reached thousands of dollars per acre with a 20% royalty and five-year term—were too steep. Looking at other mineral trends in the northern Midwest, Pagano became fascinated with potash and puzzled by Mosaic’s little Hersey operation. Why hadn’t it expanded?[IMAGE]
Despite being based in Florida, Mosaic mines nearly all its potash in Saskatchewan, and sells it via Canpotex (Canadian Potash Exporters) through its 50/50 partnership with Canadian fertilizer giant Nutrien (2024 sales: $26 billion). Canpotex, alongside Belarusalki of Belarus and Russia’s Uralki, make up an oligopoly that controls more than 70% of global supply.
After exhausting his own funds, Pagano raised $250,000 more from friends and family in exchange for 13% of his company. Since then, the only outside money Michigan Potash has taken is a $50 million grant from Michigan’s state agriculture department in 2023 and a new $80 million grant from the USDA, crucial to getting through permitting.
When Pagano initially approached the U.S. Department of Energy for funding in 2021, he got the cold shoulder. Michigan Potash was tiny and unproven. But he and his team persisted—and in 2025, as the war in Ukraine dragged on, the DOE agreed to a 15-year, $1.3 billion loan. But it came with conditions: Pagano must raise $500 million in equity, and to reduce risk Michigan Potash will outsource construction under a lump-sum, turnkey contract. “Now [the DOE] look like geniuses,” says Cory Christofferson, Michigan Potash’s chief development officer.
How To Play It
By William Baldwin
What if we run short of potassium or phosphorus? That would be bad news for farmers and, by extension, the human race. It’s an element—two elements—of the coming environmental doom postulated by the accomplished, but perhaps too pessimistic, money manager Jeremy Grantham. If you share his pessimism, it would make sense to acquire a stake in a potash and phosphate producer. Two of the big ones are Nutrien and Mosaic, both trading on the Big Board and both paying above-market yields. They are priced, respectively, at 23 and 19 times what Value Line sees for earnings this year.
William Baldwin is Forbes’ Investment Strategies columnist.
To extract the potash, Pagano will use a form of “in-situ,” or solution mining. He’ll drill 8,000-foot-deep wells in pairs. One is the injection well, down which Michigan Potash will send hot water to dissolve potash and salt in place. The second is the production well; the solution travels up that well to the processing plant for separation and drying. The water is reclaimed, heated and sent back down the hole. From the surface the mine will hardly be noticeable and should be eligible for green tax credits. “There’s no hair on this project that we’re ashamed of,” says chief operating officer Aric Glasser.
In all, Forbes estimates that costs should come to about $140 per ton; potash sells for about $350 a ton today. Global giant Mosaic can produce potash for less—about $80 a ton—but Midwestern farmers are still on the hook for another $80 per ton in rail shipping costs from Saskatchewan, 1,200 miles away, plus any tariffs that President Trump might choose to impose (currently 10% on Canadian potash). Agricultural giant ADM has already agreed to buy nearly all of Pagano’s yearly potash production.
Mosaic rejected Pagano’s offers to buy some or all of its remaining Hersey plant and, citing high costs, shut down its potash operation there in 2013. It sold the remaining salt processing operation to Cargill for $55 million. “They thought they didn’t have to worry about competition,” Christofferson says.
Vladimir Putin’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine changed that thinking. The EU banned the import or even transit of Russian and Belarussian fertilizers. China banned potash exports to conserve supply for its domestic market. Prices soared to $1,200 per ton. To keep a lid on costs, neither President Biden nor Trump has banned or sanctioned imported Russian potash.
Every ton Pagano can supply domestically should make more potash available outside the U.S. in international markets including sub-Saharan Africa, whose farmers desperately need fertilizer. “It takes a crisis to wake people up out of complacency,” Pagano says. And it takes an intrepid contrarian to challenge an oligopoly.","How An Unassuming Geologist Cracked The Global Fertilizer Cartel Michigan is sitting on a motherlode of potash and Ted Pagano is using $1.3 billion in government funds to mine it and grab market share away from Canada and Russia.

With a resource base proven to be 130 million tons, they could keep that up for a century or more—and make Pagano, who owns 65%, very rich. Even now his stake is worth at least $300 million. Pagano grew up in Greeley, Colorado, the son of a tax preparer and an assistant librarian. After graduating from Notre Dame in 1997, he earned a master’s degree in petroleum engineering from the Colorado School of Mines. He got his start in the oil industry as a roustabout in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, then worked as a geologist for Alaska’s Bristol Bay Native Corporation. (He is part Aleut, the indigenous people of the Aleutian Islands.) From there he worked at Texaco, Chevron and Anadarko drilling shale oil wells in Colorado. In 2008, at age 33, he struck out on his own, initially planning to lease prospective oilfields in North Dakota’s Bakken shale region, but land prices—which reached thousands of dollars per acre with a 20% royalty and five-year term—were too steep. Looking at other mineral trends in the northern Midwest, Pagano became fascinated with potash and puzzled by Mosaic’s little Hersey operation. Why hadn’t it expanded?[IMAGE] Despite being based in Florida, Mosaic mines nearly all its potash in Saskatchewan, and sells it via Canpotex (Canadian Potash Exporters) through its 50/50 partnership with Canadian fertilizer giant Nutrien (2024 sales: $26 billion). Canpotex, alongside Belarusalki of Belarus and Russia’s Uralki, make up an oligopoly that controls more than 70% of global supply. After exhausting his own funds, Pagano raised $250,000 more from friends and family in exchange for 13% of his company. Since then, the only outside money Michigan Potash has taken is a $50 million grant from Michigan’s state agriculture department in 2023 and a new $80 million grant from the USDA, crucial to getting through permitting. When Pagano initially approached the U.S. Department of Energy for funding in 2021, he got the cold shoulder. Michigan Potash was tiny and unproven. But he and his team persisted—and in 2025, as the war in Ukraine dragged on, the DOE agreed to a 15-year, $1.3 billion loan. But it came with conditions: Pagano must raise $500 million in equity, and to reduce risk Michigan Potash will outsource construction under a lump-sum, turnkey contract. “Now [the DOE] look like geniuses,” says Cory Christofferson, Michigan Potash’s chief development officer. How To Play It By William Baldwin What if we run short of potassium or phosphorus? That would be bad news for farmers and, by extension, the human race. It’s an element—two elements—of the coming environmental doom postulated by the accomplished, but perhaps too pessimistic, money manager Jeremy Grantham. If you share his pessimism, it would make sense to acquire a stake in a potash and phosphate producer. Two of the big ones are Nutrien and Mosaic, both trading on the Big Board and both paying above-market yields. They are priced, respectively, at 23 and 19 times what Value Line sees for earnings this year. William Baldwin is Forbes’ Investment Strategies columnist. To extract the potash, Pagano will use a form of “in-situ,” or solution mining. He’ll drill 8,000-foot-deep wells in pairs. One is the injection well, down which Michigan Potash will send hot water to dissolve potash and salt in place. The second is the production well; the solution travels up that well to the processing plant for separation and drying. The water is reclaimed, heated and sent back down the hole. From the surface the mine will hardly be noticeable and should be eligible for green tax credits. “There’s no hair on this project that we’re ashamed of,” says chief operating officer Aric Glasser. In all, Forbes estimates that costs should come to about $140 per ton; potash sells for about $350 a ton today. Global giant Mosaic can produce potash for less—about $80 a ton—but Midwestern farmers are still on the hook for another $80 per ton in rail shipping costs from Saskatchewan, 1,200 miles away, plus any tariffs that President Trump might choose to impose (currently 10% on Canadian potash). Agricultural giant ADM has already agreed to buy nearly all of Pagano’s yearly potash production. Mosaic rejected Pagano’s offers to buy some or all of its remaining Hersey plant and, citing high costs, shut down its potash operation there in 2013. It sold the remaining salt processing operation to Cargill for $55 million. “They thought they didn’t have to worry about competition,” Christofferson says. Vladimir Putin’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine changed that thinking. The EU banned the import or even transit of Russian and Belarussian fertilizers. China banned potash exports to conserve supply for its domestic market. Prices soared to $1,200 per ton. To keep a lid on costs, neither President Biden nor Trump has banned or sanctioned imported Russian potash. Every ton Pagano can supply domestically should make more potash available outside the U.S. in international markets including sub-Saharan Africa, whose farmers desperately need fertilizer. “It takes a crisis to wake people up out of complacency,” Pagano says. And it takes an intrepid contrarian to challenge an oligopoly.",Neutral,1.0

Forbes,Simone Biles Apologizes To Riley Gaines For Personal Comment Made During Trans Athlete Dispute,https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2025/06/10/simone-biles-apologizes-to-riley-gaines-for-personal-comment-made-during-trans-athlete-dispute/,,"Topline
Olympic gymnast Simone Biles apologized to former collegiate swimmer and right-wing activist Riley Gaines on Tuesday for a personal comment she made as the two argued over a championship-winning high school softball player last weekend, though Biles maintained children “should never be the focus of criticism of a flawed system they have no control over.”
Key Facts
Biles, who blasted Gaines for calling the trans softball player a boy and told her to “bully someone your own size, which would ironically be a male,” said in her apology “it didn’t help for me to get personal with Riley, which I apologize for.”
Biles said in her apology she was “not advocating for policies that compromise fairness in women’s sports” after telling Gaines on Saturday she should be “finding a way to make sports inclusive OR creating a new avenue where trans feel safe in sports.”
“My objection is to be singling out children for public scrutiny in ways that feel personal and harmful,” Biles said.
Gaines accepted Biles’ apology in a post Tuesday, saying Biles knows what being body-shamed feels like and that she is “still the greatest female gymnast of all time.”
Gaines added sports are inclusive by nature but said competition is exclusive, “So the idea of ‘competitive equity’ is nonsensical.”

The spat between Biles and Gaines began after Gaines noted the Minnesota State High School League removed comments from an X post showing the team that won the state’s softball championship. Gaines said the removed comments were to “be expected when your star player is a boy.” Biles called Gaines “truly sick” and said the activist’s larger-scale campaigning against transgender athletes was because she lost a race in college—a reference to Gaines’ fifth-place tie with trans swimmer Lia Thomas in an NCAA championship event in 2022. Gaines said it was not her job or the job of any woman “to figure out how to include men in our spaces.” She also made a comparison between Biles “when she had to endure a predatory man,” showing a clip of her testimony on convicted mass sexual abuser Larry Nassar, and Biles “when other girls have to endure predatory men,” showing her tweet defending the trans softball player.
Key Background
Gaines, who was a 12-time All-American swimmer for the University of Kentucky, became a right-wing activist following her tie with Thomas, which eventually led her to suing the NCAA over allegations it violated her civil rights by allowing Thomas to compete. The lawsuit has not yet been resolved. Gaines is one of the most vocal supporters of President Donald Trump’s agenda against transgender athletes. The president signed an executive order in February banning trans athletes from women’s sports at all levels and threatening to pull federal funding from schools allowing transgender athletes to participate in women’s categories. There are fewer than 10 transgender athletes within the NCAA’s roughly 530,000 student-athlete roster, according to Senate testimony given by NCAA president Charlie Baker last year.

Trump and Hegseth will travel to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on Tuesday to celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary, the Defense Department said. Trump is expected to address troops at the base.
Why Did Protests Break Out In Los Angeles?
Protests broke out Friday and Saturday in Paramount and Compton, cities adjacent to Los Angeles, over immigration raids conducted by ICE, during which the agency detained 44 immigrants Friday and 118 immigrants Saturday, the Associated Press reported. Police and protesters clashed over the weekend, according to local reports and videos on social media, with law enforcement using tear gas and flash grenades to break up the crowds while some protesters threw rocks and lit vehicles on fire.
California City Ends Contracts With Homeland Security, Ice
Glendale, California, announced Sunday the city had terminated an agreement with Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement that allowed the agencies to house federal detainees at the city’s police facility. Glendale officials said the move was “a local decision and was not made lightly,” as the city “recognizes that public perception of the ICE contract—no matter how limited or carefully managed, no matter the good—has become divisive.” Glendale’s city manager opted to end the contract after “careful evaluation of legal, operational and community considerations,” the city said, noting the decision was not “politically driven.”
Does Trump Have The Authority To Deploy The California National Guard?
Trump reportedly said in a memo he is invoking Title 10 of the U.S. Code on Armed Services, which allows the federal government to deploy the National Guard if the United States is “invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation,” or if there is a “rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” Vice President JD Vance said in a post on X on Saturday night the influx of immigrants, which he called “Biden’s border crisis,” amounts to an “invasion,” rebuffing critics who have questioned whether Trump had the authority to deploy troops. Trump’s move has faced some pushback from constitutional scholars. “For the federal government to take over the California National Guard, without the request of the governor, to put down protests is truly chilling,” Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California Berkeley School of Law, told the Los Angeles Times.

Protests broke out Friday and Saturday in Paramount and Compton, cities adjacent to Los Angeles, over immigration raids conducted by ICE, during which the agency detained 44 immigrants Friday and 118 immigrants Saturday, the Associated Press reported.

Trump reportedly said in a memo he is invoking Title 10 of the U.S. Code on Armed Services, which allows the federal government to deploy the National Guard if the United States is “invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation,” or if there is a “rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” Vice President JD Vance said in a post on X on Saturday night the influx of immigrants, which he called “Biden’s border crisis,” amounts to an “invasion,” rebuffing critics who have questioned whether Trump had the authority to deploy troops.
